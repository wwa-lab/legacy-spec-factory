# Output Contract: Module Analysis

This document defines the precise file shape and required fields for each
of the six artifacts in `04_modules/<MODULE-SLUG>/`.

The canonical model is in `../../../docs/module-analysis-model.md`. This
document defines the *file format*; that document defines the *intent*.

# Module: [Business Module Name] (MODULE-<SLUG>-001)

## Metadata
- **Module ID:** MODULE-AUTH-MODULE-001
- **Business Name:** Authorization Processing
- **Scope Statement:** [one paragraph from SME]
- **Module Owner:** [SME name / role]
- **In-scope Flows:** [list of FLOW-* with link to each flow analysis]
- **Status:** draft | needs_sme_review | approved | approved_with_non_blocking_tbd | 
  blocked_pending_source | blocked_pending_sme | rejected

**Blocked Status Values:**
- `blocked_pending_source`: One or more required flow analyses or program analyses are missing or incomplete
- `blocked_pending_sme`: Module boundary, scope, or critical SME input (e.g., BAU notes) is missing

## View Index
| View | File | Status | Reviewer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Operation Flow | 01-operation-flow.md | [status] | [SME name] |
| 2. System Flow | 02-system-flow.md | [status] | [SME name] |
| 3. Program Flow | 03-program-flow.md | [status] | [SME name] |
| 4. Data Flow | 04-data-flow.md | [status] | [SME name] |

## Top Blocking TBDs
(Aggregate of `pending_source` and `pending_sme_judgment` TBDs from all four views.)

## Capability Seeds For spec-writer
(Module-level capability candidates; one row per CAP-*; the spec-writer
resolves each into one or more `spec.yaml` artifacts.)

| CAP Seed | Business Signal | Evidence Basis | SME Question |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CAP-AUTH-MODULE-001 | Primary authorization event has its own business outcome, actors, and policy cluster | View 1 business event + View 3 entry flow evidence | Is the primary authorization flow a distinct business capability or part of a broader authorization capability? |

Capability seeds must be framed around business events, outcomes, policy
clusters, or operational ownership. Program flow and data flow are evidence for
the boundary; they are not the boundary itself.

## Module Review Checklist
- [ ] All four views are at least `approved_with_non_blocking_tbd`
- [ ] Cross-view consistency check passed (see view 3 ↔ view 1 actor mapping, etc.)
- [ ] No blocking TBDs remain
- [ ] Capability seeds reviewed by spec-writer SME

## Review Checklist — View 1

Per the SME Review Questions in SKILL.md, the reviewer should verify:

- [ ] **Business actors complete?** All roles interacting with the module are named; no inferred actors (e.g., "probably marketing uses this")
- [ ] **BAU rhythm correct?** Cut-off times, peak hours, seasonal patterns match operational reality
- [ ] **Exception procedures accurate?** Manual intervention points and escalation paths match how the team actually handles failures
- [ ] **Business-rule seeds reasonable?** Seeds are phrased as open questions, not invented rules
- [ ] **Evidence linked?** Every major actor, event, BAU cadence, and intervention links to SME confirmation or source document
- [ ] **No code-hallucinations?** No procedures, actors, or timing derived solely from program names / table names

# View 4: Data Flow — [Module Name]

## Status: draft | needs_sme_review | approved | approved_with_non_blocking_tbd | blocked_pending_source | rejected

## Data Objects in Scope
(Aggregated from every flow's Cross-Program Data Flow section, backed by
program Data Touch Maps and Object Dependencies.)

| Object / Carrier | Type | Inventory ID | Producer Flows | Consumer Flows | State Impact Summary | Coupling Score | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DATA-TXN-LOG | PF | OBJ-AUTH-MODULE-050 | FLOW-AUTH-001, FLOW-MANUAL-001 | FLOW-BATCH-001 | created by online/manual flows; read by batch | 3 (HIGH) | EV |
| DATA-POSTING | PF | OBJ-AUTH-MODULE-060 | FLOW-BATCH-001 | (external — posting system) | created as file handoff | 1 | EV |
| DATA-STATE | *DTAARA | OBJ-AUTH-MODULE-070 | FLOW-BATCH-001 | FLOW-BATCH-001 | read and updated as shared checkpoint | 1 (internal) | EV |
| DATA-MASTER | PF | OBJ-AUTH-MODULE-080 | (external) | FLOW-AUTH-001 | read-only lookup | 1 | EV |

## Data Lifecycle
| Object / Carrier | Created By | Updated By | Read By | Sent / Received By | Archived By | Purged By |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DATA-TXN-LOG | FLOW-AUTH-001 (per event) | (none — append-only) | FLOW-BATCH-001, FLOW-MANUAL-001 | n/a | (monthly archive job — out of module) | (yearly purge — out of module) |

## Coupling Hotspots (Modernization Risks)
| Object | Coupling Score | Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DATA-TXN-LOG | HIGH (3 flows) | Schema change ripples through all flows | Maintain backward compatibility; version transactions |

## Critical Data Trails
[End-to-end paths of important data, using flow `DATA-*` rows as anchors
— e.g., authorization request -> DTAQ -> online program -> AUTHLOG -> GL
posting -> archive.]

## DB Table Relationships
[ER-style diagram or table listing PK/FK relationships among the module's
PF / LF / SQL tables.]

## Cross-Module Data Dependencies
| Object | Owned By Module | Used By This Module | Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DATA-MASTER | MASTER-DATA module | AUTH-MODULE (read-only lookup) | Direct CHAIN |
| DATA-POSTING | (this module produces; Accounting consumes) | n/a | File handoff |

## TBDs

| TBD ID | Category | Title | Required SME | Evidence Ref | Blocking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TBD-AUTH-MODULE-301 | pending_sme | DATA-POSTING archival policy | Data Owner | (awaiting data governance) | no |

## Review Checklist — View 4

Per the SME Review Questions in SKILL.md, the reviewer should verify:

- [ ] **Data lifecycle correct?** Created / Updated / Read / Archived / Purged lifecycle per object matches code evidence and BAU (View 1)
- [ ] **Coupling hotspots match reality?** HIGH coupling scores point to objects that are actually "scary to change" in operations
- [ ] **Cross-module dependencies identified?** Every object consumed by another module or producing for external systems is listed
- [ ] **DB relationships documented?** PK/FK, versioning, and archival strategy are clear
- [ ] **Evidence linked?** Each object and lifecycle phase references an EV-* ID, OBJ-* ID, or FLOW-* from approved analyses
- [ ] **No hallucinated fields?** Coupling scores and lifecycle phases derived solely from code and flow evidence, not speculation
