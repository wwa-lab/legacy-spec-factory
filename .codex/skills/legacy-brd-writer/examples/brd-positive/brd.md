## 1. Capability Overview

### Scope Statement

**In Scope:**
- Credit limit validation for online and phone orders
- Rejection of orders that exceed customer credit limit
- Error messaging and transaction logging

**Out of Scope:**
- Cash/check orders (no credit limit applies)
- Internal admin overrides
- Credit limit modification or adjustment workflows

### Business Owner

- **Name / Role:** John Smith, Credit Policy Manager
- **Contact:** john.smith@company.com

### Business Value

Credit limit enforcement prevents credit exposure on orders. This capability
protects the company's financial position by ensuring no customer exceeds their
authorized credit threshold.

---

## 2. As-Is Business Process Summary

### Business Trigger

A customer submits an order using credit terms.

### Business Participants and Systems

- **Primary business party:** Customer placing the order
- **System role:** Checks the order amount against the customer's authorized
  credit limit before the order is accepted
- **External / downstream party:** Order fulfillment and audit/reporting
  consumers that rely on the accept/reject decision

### Current-State Flow

1. The order is received with customer and credit amount information.
2. The customer's authorized credit limit is retrieved from the customer master
   record.
3. The order is either allowed to continue or rejected immediately when the
   credit amount exceeds the authorized limit.
4. Rejections are logged so credit policy and operations stakeholders can review
   exposure-control activity.

### Business Outcomes and Controls

- **Normal outcome:** The order proceeds only when it is within the customer's
  authorized credit limit.
- **Exception outcome:** The order is rejected with a credit-limit error when
  the amount exceeds the authorized threshold.
- **Control or audit point:** Credit-limit rejections are written to the audit
  file with the customer, amount, limit, timestamp, and return code.

### Implementation Evidence Boundary

Program and file details are retained in the observed behaviors and evidence
index only where they support traceability.

## 3. Observed Behaviors

### BEH-CREDIT-LIMIT-001: Order Amount Validation

**Statement:** When an order is submitted with a credit amount, the system
compares the credit amount against the customer's authorized credit limit
retrieved from the CUSTPF (Customer Master File). If the order amount exceeds
the limit, the system rejects the order and returns error code 42.

**Evidence:** `EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-001` (program analysis section 3.2)

**Knowledge Type:** `observed_behavior`  
**Confidence:** `high`

---

### BEH-CREDIT-LIMIT-002: Error Rejection Flow

**Statement:** When an order is rejected due to credit limit (error code 42),
the CREDIT-CHECK program writes an error message to the response field ERRMSG
("Credit limit exceeded") and returns control to the caller with return code 42.
The order is not placed.

**Evidence:** `EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-002` (program analysis section 4.1), `EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-003`
(spool sample showing rejection)

**Knowledge Type:** `observed_behavior`  
**Confidence:** `high`

---

### BEH-CREDIT-LIMIT-003: Credit Limit Data Source

**Statement:** The customer's credit limit is read from the CUSTPF physical
file using the customer ID as the key. The CRDLIM field (numeric, 9 digits, 2
decimal places) is extracted. If the customer record is not found, the program
returns error code 99 (customer not found).

**Evidence:** `EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-004` (program analysis section 5.0 - data
dependency mapping)

**Knowledge Type:** `observed_behavior`  
**Confidence:** `high`

---

### BEH-CREDIT-LIMIT-004: Transaction Logging

**Statement:** When a credit limit rejection occurs (error code 42), the system
writes a log entry to the transaction audit file AUDITPF including: timestamp,
customer ID, order amount, credit limit, and return code.

**Evidence:** `EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-005` (program analysis section 6.2 - audit logging)

**Knowledge Type:** `observed_behavior`  
**Confidence:** `high`

---

## 4. Inferred Business Rules

### BR-CREDIT-LIMIT-001: Credit Limit Ceiling

**Statement:** No order with credit amount can exceed the customer's authorized
credit limit as stored in the customer master file.

**Rationale:** Inferred from BEH-CREDIT-LIMIT-001, BEH-CREDIT-LIMIT-003, and
BEH-CREDIT-LIMIT-004. The control logic, data source, and audit trail all
enforce this single policy.

**Evidence:** `EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-001`, `EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-004`, `EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-005`

**Knowledge Type:** `inferred_business_rule`  
**Confidence:** `high`  
**Review Status:** `needs_sme_review`  
**SME Decision:** `confirmed_for_spec_promotion`

**SME Notes:** ✓ Confirmed by John Smith (2026-05-15). This is the core company
policy. Applies to all order channels (online, phone). No exceptions in the
approval workflow.

---

### BR-CREDIT-LIMIT-002: Real-Time Limit Checking

**Statement:** Credit limit validation occurs at order submission time, not
deferred to a batch process. The system must return accept/reject immediately
to the caller.

**Rationale:** Inferred from BEH-CREDIT-LIMIT-001 and BEH-CREDIT-LIMIT-002. The
program checks and rejects in the same transaction. No batch processing is
evident.

**Evidence:** `EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-001`, `EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-002`

**Knowledge Type:** `inferred_business_rule`  
**Confidence:** `high`  
**Review Status:** `needs_sme_review`  
**SME Decision:** `confirmed_for_spec_promotion`

**SME Notes:** ✓ Confirmed. Customers expect immediate response to credit
checks. No batch deferral.

---

### BR-CREDIT-LIMIT-003: Customer Master is Source of Truth

**Statement:** The authorized credit limit for each customer is the value
stored in the CUSTPF (Customer Master File). This value is the authoritative
source and is never overridden by order-level settings or cached values.

**Rationale:** Inferred from BEH-CREDIT-LIMIT-003. Every credit check reads
from CUSTPF directly; no caching logic is evident in the program flow.

**Evidence:** `EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-004`

**Knowledge Type:** `inferred_business_rule`  
**Confidence:** `medium`  
**Review Status:** `needs_sme_review`  
**SME Decision:** `confirmed_for_spec_promotion`

**SME Notes:** Confirmed with caveat: CUSTPF is the master at order time.
However, credit limits can be updated by a separate workflow (out of scope).
TBD-002 covers this.

## 5. Validation Scenario Summary

See `validation-scenarios.md` for SME-reviewable `VAL-*` scenario seeds.
These are not formal `AC-*` acceptance criteria or formal `TC-*` test cases.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `VAL-CREDIT-LIMIT-001` | `happy_path` | `BR-CREDIT-LIMIT-001`, `BEH-CREDIT-LIMIT-001` | `EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-001`, `EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-004` | `ready_for_spec` | Normal approval path |
| `VAL-CREDIT-LIMIT-002` | `exception` | `BR-CREDIT-LIMIT-001`, `BR-CREDIT-LIMIT-002` | `EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-001`, `EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-002`, `EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-003` | `ready_for_spec` | Credit exceeded rejection |

## 6. Open Questions & Gaps (TBDs)

### TBD-CREDIT-LIMIT-001: Partial Credit Scenarios

**Category:** `sme_questions`  
**Statement:** If a customer has a credit limit of $1,000 and orders $900, can
a second $200 order be placed in the same session, or is the limit checked
against total pending orders?

**Evidence:** No behavior observed in the program for multi-order sessions.
Unclear if CREDIT-CHECK knows about prior orders.

**Resolver:** `SME (John Smith)`  
**Blocking:** `no` (not required to preserve current per-order legacy behavior)

**Context:** SME confirmed the legacy behavior is per-order. Aggregate pending
order exposure is a possible future policy decision, not a blocker for
preserving the current capability.

---

### TBD-CREDIT-LIMIT-002: Credit Limit Update Cadence

**Category:** `sme_questions`  
**Statement:** How frequently is the CUSTPF credit limit updated? What is the
expected latency between a credit limit change and its visibility to the
CREDIT-CHECK program?

**Evidence:** Module analysis does not cover credit limit maintenance workflows
(out of scope for CARD-AUTH module).

**Resolver:** `SME (John Smith)` or `Architecture`  
**Blocking:** `no` (non-blocking for BRD; may be important for spec-writer)

**Context:** Affects decision on caching, refresh intervals, or eventual
consistency in modernized design.

---

### TBD-CREDIT-LIMIT-003: Customer-Not-Found Handling

**Category:** `sme_questions`  
**Statement:** When a customer ID is not found in CUSTPF (error code 99), is
this an error condition that rejects the order, or does the system allow the
order with a fallback behavior?

**Evidence:** Program returns error code 99, but BRD does not clarify whether
this results in order rejection or a different flow.

**Resolver:** `SME (John Smith)`  
**Blocking:** `no` (non-blocking for BRD; spec-writer can address)

**Context:** Edge case for error handling in modernized system.
