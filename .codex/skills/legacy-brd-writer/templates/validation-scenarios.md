# BRD Validation Scenarios: `<CAPABILITY-NAME>`

**BRD ID:** `BRD-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001`
**Capability ID:** `CAP-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001`
**Status:** `draft` | `in_review` | `approved`

## Purpose

This file captures SME-reviewable validation scenario seeds for the BRD.
They help reviewers confirm legacy business behavior during migration discovery
and, only for items later promoted beyond discovery, help downstream teams plan
acceptance criteria, golden master tests, and SOW scope.

These are **not** formal acceptance criteria and **not** executable test cases.
Do not mint `AC-*` or `TC-*` here. Formal `AC-*` entries are produced by
`legacy-spec-writer`; formal `TC-*` entries are produced by
`legacy-golden-master-test-planner` after spec approval and runtime evidence
review.

## Scenario Seeds

### VAL-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001: `<Scenario Title>`

**Scenario Type:** `happy_path` | `exception` | `boundary` | `negative` |
`manual_review`
**Business Goal:** `<What business behavior this scenario helps validate>`
**Related Rules:** `BR-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001`
**Related Behaviors:** `BEH-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001`
**Evidence:** `EV-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001`, `EV-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-002`
**SME Question:** `<What should the SME confirm or correct?>`
**Expected Business Outcome:** `<Business-level outcome only; do not invent exact outputs>`
**Data Needed Later:** `<Sample transaction, field set, spool sample, or runtime evidence needed for TC-* planning>`
**Readiness:** `ready_for_spec` | `needs_sme_review` | `needs_runtime_evidence` |

**Notes:**

```
<Optional notes for SME / BA / downstream test planner>
```

### VAL-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-002: `<Scenario Title>`

**Scenario Type:** `exception`
**Business Goal:** `<What exception or edge behavior this scenario validates>`
**Related Rules:** `BR-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-002`
**Related Behaviors:** `BEH-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-002`
**Evidence:** `EV-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-003`
**SME Question:** `<What policy or interpretation is unclear?>`
**Expected Business Outcome:** `<Business-level outcome only>`
**Data Needed Later:** `<Runtime sample / expected output evidence needed>`
**Readiness:** `needs_sme_review`

**Notes:**

```
<Optional notes>
```

## Deferred Scenarios

Use this section when a useful validation scenario cannot be drafted safely
because evidence is missing or contradictory.

| Deferred Scenario | Related BR/BEH | Blocking Reason | Resolver | Next Step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<Scenario idea>` | `BR-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-003` | `missing_runtime_evidence` | `<SME / Source Owner>` | `<Collect sample transaction / answer TBD>` |

## SME Review Checklist

- [ ] Every `VAL-*` scenario maps to at least one `BR-*` or `BEH-*`.
- [ ] No `VAL-*` scenario introduces a new business rule.
- [ ] No scenario contains formal `AC-*`, formal `TC-*`, target architecture,
      implementation detail, or invented exact output.
- [ ] Deferred scenarios are tied to explicit evidence gaps or SME questions.
- [ ] Scenario coverage is sufficient for the SME to review the BRD scope.
