# BRD Traceability Report: `<CAPABILITY-NAME>`

**BRD ID:** `BRD-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001`  
**Capability ID:** `CAP-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001`  
**Generated:** `<YYYY-MM-DD>`

## Overview

This report shows the complete traceability between BRD elements (observed
behaviors, inferred rules, validation scenario seeds, open questions) and their
supporting evidence.

**Coverage:**
- **Observed Behaviors:** X documented
- **Inferred Business Rules:** Y identified (all `needs_sme_review`)
- **Validation Scenarios:** V drafted (all `VAL-*`; no formal `AC-*` or `TC-*`)
- **Open Questions (TBDs):** Z defined (A blocking, B non-blocking)
- **Evidence Items:** N collected

---

## 1. Observed Behaviors → Evidence

Every observed behavior must trace to at least one evidence item.

| BEH ID | Behavior | Evidence | Source | Strength |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BEH-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001` | `<Behavior title>` | `EV-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001` | flow-<FLOW-SLUG>.md | `confirmed_from_code` |
| `BEH-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-002` | `<Behavior title>` | `EV-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-002`, `EV-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-003` | program-analysis-<OBJ-ID>.md, spool sample | `confirmed_from_code`, `observed_in_runtime` |

**Validation:** All BEH-* items have supporting evidence ✓ / ✗

---

## 2. Inferred Business Rules → Behaviors & Evidence

Every inferred business rule must trace to one or more observed behaviors and
at least one evidence item.

| BR ID | Rule | Supports BEH | Evidence | Support Summary | Review Status | SME Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BR-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001` | `<Rule title>` | `BEH-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001`, `BEH-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-002` | `EV-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001`, `EV-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-002` | direct code/runtime evidence in linked EV records | `needs_sme_review` | `pending` |
| `BR-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-002` | `<Rule title>` | `BEH-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-003` | `EV-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-004` | weak support; needs SME judgment | `needs_sme_review` | `pending` |

**Validation:** All BR-* items have supporting BEH and EV ✓ / ✗

---

## 3. Validation Scenarios → Rules / Behaviors / Evidence

Every validation scenario seed must trace to an existing rule or behavior and
at least one evidence item. `VAL-*` entries do not introduce new requirements.

| VAL ID | Scenario | Type | Related BR/BEH | Evidence | Readiness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `VAL-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001` | `<Scenario title>` | `happy_path` | `BR-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001`, `BEH-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001` | `EV-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001` | `ready_for_spec` |
| `VAL-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-002` | `<Scenario title>` | `exception` | `BR-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-002` | `EV-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-004` | `needs_sme_review` |

**Validation:** All VAL-* items map to BR/BEH and EV; none mint AC-* or TC-* ✓ / ✗

---

## 4. Open Questions (TBDs)

Every open question is categorized and assigned to a resolver.

| TBD ID | Question | Category | Evidence Gap | Resolver | Blocking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TBD-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001` | `<Question>` | `sme_questions` | Program A vs. Program B behavior unclear | `SME` | Yes (this step) |
| `TBD-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-002` | `<Question>` | `evidence_gaps` | Missing spool sample for scenario X | `Source Owner` | No (non-blocking) |
| `TBD-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-003` | `<Question>` | `downstream_handoff_blockers` | Unclear whether this rule applies post-modernization | `Architecture` | No (spec-writer can mark as TBD) |

**Categories:**
- `missing_inputs` — upstream artifact or gate missing
- `evidence_gaps` — evidence itself is missing, unreadable, unredacted
- `contradictory_evidence` — two evidence items conflict
- `sme_questions` — only SME judgment can answer
- `downstream_handoff_blockers` — non-blocking for this step, but needs resolution before next step

**Validation:** All TBD-* items have a category, resolver, and blocking status ✓ / ✗
