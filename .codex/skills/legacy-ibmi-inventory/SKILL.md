# IBM i Legacy Inventory

## Skill Card

| Field | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Problem solved | Builds the object map and baseline inventory needed before deeper IBM i analysis can be trusted. |
| Input | Approved evidence manifest, source members, DDS, DB2 metadata, jobs, screens, reports, spool/runtime references, and object metadata. |
| Output | `inventory.yaml`, `object-map.md`, readiness status, gaps, and blocked object notes. |
| Core prompt strategy | Enumerate assets conservatively, assign stable `OBJ-*` IDs, mark confidence/readiness, and block missing or unauthorized evidence. |
| Upstream skill | `legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake`. |
| Downstream consumer | Program, flow, module, screen/report, data-model, and runtime-evidence skills. |
| Validation standard | Inventory Completeness Gate passes or blocks clearly; every downstream object reference can resolve to `inventory.yaml`. |
| Known risk | Missing a file, trigger, job, or display object that later invalidates program or flow analysis. |
| Practical example | Inventory an order subsystem's RPGLE programs, CL jobs, PF/LF files, DSPFs, and reports before program analysis starts. |

## Purpose

Create a structured inventory of IBM i / AS400 legacy assets for one business
capability. This skill does not infer business rules and does not generate
Java. It establishes the evidence baseline required before deeper analysis or
`spec.yaml` generation.

## Inputs

Accept any combination of:

- source member listings or exported source files
- normalized document-intake / flow-normalization packages that contain IBM i
  program, job, file, ARCAD, DSPPGMREF, Program Spec, File Spec, or data
  dictionary anchors
- RPGLE, CLLE, COBOL, DDS source
- DB2 for i table and field metadata
- job descriptions, scheduler notes, or CL command flow
- DSPF, PRTF, spool, report, and screen samples
- SME notes about known programs, files, jobs, reports, or hidden dependencies

If raw production samples, logs, spool, screenshots, or DB extracts are present
without source-path authorization or required redaction approval, stop and route
to `legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake`. Internal source members and metadata may be
used when the evidence manifest records `source_path_verified: true`.

## Output Contract

Produce:

- `01_inventory/inventory.yaml`
- `01_inventory/object-map.md`
- `01_inventory/inventory-review-checklist.md`
- unresolved questions using `TBD-<SLUG>-<NNN>` IDs

Use the templates in:

- `templates/inventory.yaml`
- `templates/inventory-review-checklist.md`

Follow:

- `../../docs/id-conventions.md`
- `../../docs/evidence-and-knowledge-taxonomy.md`
- `../../docs/input-readiness-rubric.md`
- `references/output-contract.md`

Examples:

- `examples/redacted-customer-credit-check/`
- `examples/missing-artifact-negative-case/`

## Step Contract

This skill is one step in the Legacy Spec Factory reverse chain. It conforms
to the canonical Step Contract shape — see
`../legacy-step-contract/SKILL.md` and
`../legacy-step-contract/references/step-contract.md` for the full
field-level rules. The summary below is normative for this skill.

### Input

- **Required**: evidence manifest at `package_state: approved_for_inventory`
  plus approved analysis paths for source members, DDS, DB2 metadata,
  job/scheduler notes, screen/spool/report samples; capability scope
  (name + slug + libraries + collection date); assigned intake reviewer.
- **Optional**: prior shop inventory spreadsheets, wiki references, vendor
  docs (treat as tier 3/4 hints, never as ground truth); assigned SME owner
  when available for inventory completeness review.
- **Input readiness scoring**:
  - `0-5 blocked`: approved manifest missing, required source/object listings
    unavailable, evidence authorization unresolved, scope is the whole
    application, or no stable capability slug exists.
  - `6 minimum_pass`: approved manifest, ground-truth source/object listings,
    approved analysis paths, capability scope, and intake reviewer are present.
  - `7-8 usable`: DDS/DB metadata, job/scheduler notes, and screen/report
    samples are included for most referenced objects.
  - `9-10 strong`: SME hints, prior inventory, runtime/spool samples, hidden
    dependency notes, and downstream focus are also supplied.
  - Missing SME owner does not block starting inventory; it blocks marking
    inventory done if SME completeness review is required.
- **Readiness checks**: Evidence Authorization Gate has cleared each evidence
  item; no `sensitivity: unknown`; capability slug stable; every item has
  either `source_path_verified: true` or completed required redaction.
- **Stop conditions**: unauthorized raw production evidence is present;
  capability is "the whole application" (require a narrower slice);
  ground-truth tier 1 source listings (`WRKOBJ` / `DSPOBJD` /
  source-member listings) are not available. If only document-derived anchors
  are available, produce a candidate `object-map.md` with confidence and
  `TBD-*` gaps, and keep SME review from approving it as complete until source
  or owner confirmation resolves the gaps.

### Execution

- **Procedure**: see the Workflow section below (7 ordered steps).
- **Allowed inference**: cross-referencing a referenced object against the
  inventory; classifying object types from DDS/source headers; assigning
  evidence IDs.
- **Forbidden assumptions**: inventing libraries, programs, files, fields,
  jobs, reports, or calls; inferring business rules from inventory alone;
  treating source comments or prior spreadsheets as truth without tier-1
  verification.
- **TBD handling**: use `TBD-<SLUG>-<NNN>`. Distinguish `coverage_gaps`
  (artifact missing — a developer can fix) from `open_questions` (only an
  SME can answer) per `references/output-contract.md`.

### Output

- **Canonical artifacts**: `01_inventory/inventory.yaml`,
  `01_inventory/object-map.md`,
  `01_inventory/inventory-review-checklist.md`.
- **Required fields/sections**: capability metadata, evidence ledger, object
  inventory, relationship map, `coverage_gaps`, `open_questions`,
  `sme_review`.
- **Required IDs**: `OBJ-*` for every object; `EV-*` for every evidence
  item; `TBD-*` for every gap or open question. No `BR-*`, `BEH-*`, or
  `DEC-*` minted here.
- **Handoff status**: `sme_review.decision` must be `approved` or
  `approved_with_non_blocking_tbd` before downstream skills run; `blocked`
  halts the chain.

### Validation

- **Mechanical**: every object has `id`, `evidence_ids`, and a non-`unknown`
  sensitivity; every relationship resolves to two `OBJ-*`; every TBD
  carries a category; required files exist.
- **AI semantic**: object scope matches the capability slug; no inferred
  business rules sneaking into `notes`; comments/spreadsheets cited as
  hints, not as ground truth; PRTF/DSPF/PF/LF/job/subroutine gaps surfaced
  as TBDs rather than smoothed over.
- **SME / human approval**: SME records `sme_review.decision`, signed-off
  object coverage, hidden-dependency confirmation, report/spool confirmation,
  and any sensitivity confirmation that required SME judgment. SME review is
  the gate for marking inventory done, not for starting developer-led inventory
  from an approved evidence manifest.
- **Blocking conditions**: any object lacks an ID or evidence link; any
  `sensitivity: unknown` remains; SME marks `decision: blocked`; any
  `coverage_gaps` entry with `blocking: yes` is unresolved.

Emit a Step Validation Report (see
`../legacy-step-contract/templates/step-validation-report.md`) with status
`pass`, `pass_with_warnings`, or `blocked` when reporting upward to the
orchestrator.

## Workflow

1. **Define capability scope**
   Identify the business capability name, slug, source libraries, date of
   collection, and known reviewer/SME owner when available. If the scope is a
   whole application, ask for a narrower slice.

2. **Classify input evidence**
   Assign evidence IDs to each source bundle, metadata export, report sample,
   spool sample, job log, screen sample, and SME note. Mark sensitivity as
   `public`, `internal`, `confidential`, or `unknown`, preserving
   `source_path_verified` / `redaction_required` status from the evidence
   manifest.

3. **Inventory legacy objects**
   Extract or list programs, service programs, CL commands, PF, LF, DSPF, PRTF,
   jobs, reports, data areas, data queues, message queues, copybooks, and
   external interfaces.
   When objects come from Program Specs, File Specs, ARCAD lists, DSPPGMREF
   exports, or normalized document/context packages, mark the evidence source
   and confidence explicitly; do not treat document mentions as source-verified
   unless the evidence manifest or SME review confirms them.

4. **Capture relationships**
   Record known or observed relationships:

   - program calls
   - file usage
   - display file usage
   - printer file usage
   - submitted jobs
   - external calls
   - control tables
   - data areas and queues

5. **Identify coverage gaps**
   Create TBDs for missing DDS, missing PRTF, unresolved called programs,
   unknown job flow, unclear screen/report artifacts, or evidence awaiting
   authorization/redaction.

6. **Prepare SME review**
   Generate an inventory review checklist that asks the SME to confirm object
   coverage, hidden dependencies, critical reports, and missing runtime
   evidence.

7. **Gate the output**
   Do not mark the inventory `approved` unless:

   - every listed object has an ID
   - every object links to evidence or SME confirmation
   - missing objects are explicit TBDs
   - sensitivity is not `unknown`
   - PRTF, DSPF, PF/LF, job, and deep subroutine gaps are called out

## Program Criticality Classification

Every program object in `inventory.yaml` MUST carry a `criticality` field
with one of `critical | standard | low_risk`. This drives SME review
routing downstream — without it, every program gets equal review
intensity and the SME bandwidth bottleneck cannot be relieved.

Apply the heuristic in
[`references/criticality-classifier.md`](references/criticality-classifier.md).
Default to `standard` when the heuristic does not match a `critical` or
`low_risk` pattern.

Schema addition to each `objects[]` entry of type `program`:

```yaml
- id: OBJ-<MODULE>-<NAME>
  type: program
  # ... existing fields ...
  criticality: critical | standard | low_risk
  criticality_reason: <one-line why, e.g. "writes ARMAST" or "read-only display program">
  criticality_confirmed_by_sme: false   # flipped to true after SME signoff
```

**SME confirmation is a single batched step**, not per-program:

1. Inventory skill auto-classifies all programs using the heuristic.
2. Inventory skill emits a per-bucket count summary to the SME
   (see `criticality-classifier.md` → "SME confirmation"):
   ```
   critical:  12 programs   (need deep SME review)
   standard:  21 programs   (spot-check sample)
   low_risk:  14 programs   (batch confirm)
   ```
3. SME confirms the partitioning OR names specific programs to reclassify
   with reasons.
4. After SME signoff, set `criticality_confirmed_by_sme: true` on every
   reclassified entry, and record the confirmation moment in
   `inventory.yaml.sme_review.criticality_confirmed_at: <ISO date>`.

Until step 4 completes, downstream skills MUST treat every program as
`standard` (the conservative default) to prevent under-reviewing a
mis-classified `critical` program.

**Anti-pattern:** do NOT use criticality to skip program analysis for
`low_risk` programs. The analysis is still produced at full depth — only
the SME review effort downstream is dialed down.

## Downstream Skill Triggers (DSPF + Data Model)

Two supplemental Layer 1 skills are **optional for tiny modules but
mandatory once inventory contents trigger them**. Without this trigger
mechanism, screen-derived business rules and shared data-model
invariants slip through into ad-hoc program-analysis prose.

Detect during inventory; SME confirms in the same single batched signoff
as criticality.

### Auto-detect rules (apply during inventory)

Set `inventory.yaml.sme_review.downstream_required.screen_report_analyzer.required: true` when ANY of:

- inventory has an object with `subtype ∈ {dspf, display_file, menu}`
- inventory has `subtype: prtf` AND the report carries business
  decisions (totals lines, conditional rows) — not pure output

Set `inventory.yaml.sme_review.downstream_required.data_model_analyzer.required: true` when ANY of:

- count(objects with `subtype ∈ {pf, physical_file, lf, logical_file, sql_table, table}`) ≥ 3
- two files share a key field name (foreign-key-like relation)
- any program writes to ≥ 2 master files (compound transactional update)

Full rule set, examples, and overrides documented in
[`references/downstream-triggers.md`](references/downstream-triggers.md).

### Inventory output additions

Append the trigger block to `inventory.yaml`:

```yaml
sme_review:
  decision: approved
  criticality_summary: { critical: N, standard: M, low_risk: K }
  downstream_required:
    screen_report_analyzer:
      required: true | false
      reason: <one line — why detected or why N/A>
      triggered_by_objects: [OBJ-*, ...]    # objects that triggered the detection
    data_model_analyzer:
      required: true | false
      reason: <one line>
      triggered_by_objects: [OBJ-*, ...]
```

If SME overrides an auto-detection (e.g. a DSPF exists but is dead
code), record `override_reason` + `override_by` + `override_at` per the
schema in `downstream-triggers.md`.

### Why this matters

Once `downstream_required.<skill>.required: true` is committed in
`inventory.yaml`, the orchestrator's `3b Program Analysis Done` gate
will refuse to advance until the triggered artifact (`screen-report-analysis.md`
under `02_programs/<MODULE>/screens/`, or `04_modules/<MODULE>/data-model/dictionary.md`)
is also produced and approved. The trigger turns optional skills into
**mechanically enforced prerequisites** when their inputs are present.

## Workflow State Write-Back

At the end of an inventory run, update `<project-root>/workflow-state.yaml`
per [`docs/workflow-state-contract.md`](../../docs/workflow-state-contract.md).
Template: [`skills/legacy-modernization-orchestrator/references/state-writeback-snippet.md`](../legacy-modernization-orchestrator/references/state-writeback-snippet.md).

**Stage this skill produces:**

- `2c Inventory Done` when `inventory.yaml.sme_review.decision ∈ {approved,
  approved_with_non_blocking_tbd}` AND no `coverage_gaps[].blocking: yes`
  remains
- `2b Inventory Blocked` when `sme_review.decision: blocked` OR any
  blocking `coverage_gaps[]` is unresolved
- `2a Inventory In Progress` when the inventory is partial and `sme_review`
  is absent

**Last artifact path pattern:** `01_inventory/inventory.yaml`

**Writes per run:**

1. Overwrite `capabilities[<CAP-* from current_focus>]` (or the entry keyed
   by module slug if no CAP-* yet) with stage id, artifact path,
   `last_skill: legacy-ibmi-inventory`, and blocking IDs (`tbds`,
   `sme_pending`, `gates: ["inventory_completeness"]` if 2b).
2. Append one `history[]` entry with the run's outcome and SME decision.
3. Overwrite `project.last_updated_at` / `project.last_updated_by`.

Never touch `current_focus`, other capabilities' entries, or past
`history[]` rows. If you re-run inventory on a capability already at a
later stage, do not lower `stage_id` — surface and ask the orchestrator
to run the Rollback Protocol.

## Anti-Hallucination Rules

**Code is ground truth.** See `../../docs/code-as-ground-truth.md`. The
inventory enumerates objects that actually exist in the production
library — confirmed via current `WRKOBJ` / `DSPOBJD` / source-member
listings (tier 1). Prior inventory spreadsheets, shop catalogs, wikis,
and SME recollection are starting points (tier 3/4); every entry must
be verified against tier 1 before being recorded.

- Do not invent libraries, programs, files, fields, jobs, reports, or calls.
- If a referenced object is not present in current production, create a TBD instead of filling it in (it may be deprecated, renamed, or never have existed).
- Do not infer business rules from inventory alone.
- Do not treat source comments as truth without tier-1 verification or SME review.
- Keep `observed`, `inferred`, and `unknown` separate.

## SME Review Questions

Ask the SME to confirm:

- Are all expected programs and called routines listed?
- Are any CL-submitted jobs, job scheduler entries, or overrides missing?
- Are all PF/LF, DSPF, and PRTF objects accounted for?
- Are there control files, data areas, data queues, or message queues?
- Are reports and spool outputs tied to the correct printer files?
- Are there shop-specific naming conventions or copybooks that affect analysis?
- Which missing items block downstream program analysis or spec generation?

## Version History

- v0.3.1 (2026-05-30): Clarified that normalized document/context packages can
  seed a candidate object map, but document-derived anchors remain lower
  confidence until source or SME confirmation supports inventory approval.

- v0.3.0 (2026-05-16): Added `downstream_required` block to
  `sme_review`. Inventory now auto-detects when
  `legacy-ibmi-screen-report-analyzer` and
  `legacy-ibmi-data-model-analyzer` should be MANDATORY (not optional)
  for this module, declares the requirement in inventory.yaml, and SME
  confirms in the same batched signoff. Orchestrator's `3b Program
  Analysis Done` gate now mechanically enforces these triggers — turning
  optional supplemental skills into prerequisites when their inputs are
  present. Trigger rules in `references/downstream-triggers.md`.
- v0.2.0 (2026-05-16): Added program criticality classification
  (`critical | standard | low_risk` with `criticality_reason`) and the
  single-batched SME confirmation workflow. Drives downstream review
  routing in `legacy-sme-review-facilitator` so 200-program modules no
  longer require 200 separate SME reviews. Heuristic + anti-patterns
  documented in `references/criticality-classifier.md`.
- v0.1.0 (2026-05-13): Initial reference implementation for the Legacy Spec
  Factory review gate.
