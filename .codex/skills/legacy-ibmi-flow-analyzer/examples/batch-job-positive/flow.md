## Error Propagation & Commit Boundaries

### Error Conditions Per Node

| Node | Error Condition | Detection | Local Handling | Propagated To Caller | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NODE-02 | TXNLOGPF read I/O error | MONITOR block | logs to QSYSOPR, returns RC=-1 | NODE-01 logs + ERREXIT | EV-... |
| NODE-02 | Validation rule failure on row | row-level check | writes exception to local error file; counts errors; if > threshold, returns RC=-2 | NODE-01 logs + ERREXIT | EV-... |
| NODE-03 | PRTF open / spool error | MONITOR | logs + RC=-1 | NODE-01 logs + ERREXIT | EV-... |
| NODE-04 | SQL error (SQLCODE < 0) | SQLCODE check | logs SQLSTATE, returns RC=-1 | NODE-01 logs + ABEND | EV-... |
| NODE-04 | DTAQ send timeout | MONITOR | logs to QSYSOPR; non-fatal (continues) | RC=0 with warning | EV-... |

### Flow-Level Error Outcomes

| Trigger Error | What Happens | Operator Visibility | Recovery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NODE-02 row threshold exceeded | Job ends RC=-2, no GL posting | QSYSOPR msg + RECONPRT not produced | SME reviews exceptions; manual rerun after fix |
| NODE-04 SQL failure mid-cross-check | Job ABENDs; GLPOSTPF has new rows; HSSDTAR002 checkpoint NOT updated | QSYSOPR + spool of SQL error | **Partial restart** procedure: ops re-runs NODE-04 only against existing GLPOSTPF (SME confirmed) |
| Scheduler missed (system down) | Job not submitted; downstream cut-off at risk | manual operator detection | Ops submits manually if before 04:00; otherwise escalate |

### Commit Boundaries

```text
NODE-01 (CL setup, no commits)
    │
    ▼
NODE-02 (writes GLPOSTPF rows, non-journaled)        ← Boundary 1: each WRITE durable
    │
    ▼
NODE-03 (spool RECONPRT)                              ← Boundary 2: spool entry created
    │
    ▼
NODE-04 (SQL cross-check + DTAQ send + DTAARA update) ← Boundary 3: completion flag durable
    │
    ▼
[End — downstream GL consolidation reads GLPOSTPF after 06:00]
```

**Vulnerable Windows:**
- **Between Boundary 1 and Boundary 3:** if the job ABENDs, GLPOSTPF has
  rows but HSSDTAR002 says "not complete". The partial-restart procedure
  exists to handle this; documented as production reality but not in
  code. → SEED-NIGHTLY-RECON-04
- **Before Boundary 2:** if NODE-02 fails, GLPOSTPF has partial rows for
  the run date; partial restart re-runs NODE-02 with a "skip already
  written" check by transaction ID. → TBD-NIGHTLY-RECON-002

## Business Capability Seeds

| Seed ID | Candidate Rule / Capability | Suggested By | SME Question |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SEED-NIGHTLY-RECON-01 | All on-us card transactions for a given day must be reconciled before downstream GL consolidation | Flow runs daily; cut-off enforced by scheduler; NODE-04 updates completion flag | Is this a hard regulatory requirement or operational SLA? |
| SEED-NIGHTLY-RECON-02 | Exception threshold gates GL posting | NODE-02 returns RC=-2 if exceptions > threshold | What is the threshold value and who maintains it? |
| SEED-NIGHTLY-RECON-03 | Exception report must be human-reviewed | NODE-03 produces spool; SME confirmed Finance reviews morning | Is review required (compliance) or best-effort? |
| SEED-NIGHTLY-RECON-04 | Partial restart is a recognised recovery mode | SME-confirmed procedure to rerun NODE-04 only | Should the restart logic move into code, or remain operational procedure? |

## TBDs & Blocking Status

### Pending Source
- (none — all four program-analyses approved)

### Pending SME Judgment
- **TBD-NIGHTLY-RECON-001:** Confirm RC=-2 threshold value in NODE-02
  - Blocking: pending_sme_judgment
  - Question: NODE-02 returns RC=-2 when "exceptions exceed threshold"; threshold value not in source (read from HSSDTAR100 data area). Need value + business meaning.
  - Related: [NODE-02, OBJ-CARD-AUTH-102]

- **TBD-NIGHTLY-RECON-002:** Confirm idempotency of partial restart
  - Blocking: pending_sme_judgment
  - Question: SME-described partial restart re-runs NODE-02. Does NODE-02 detect already-written GLPOSTPF rows for the run date and skip them? Source not inspected closely.
  - Related: [NODE-02, DATA-04]

### Non-Blocking
- **TBD-NIGHTLY-RECON-003:** Document HSSDTAR002 checkpoint format
  - Blocking: non_blocking
  - Question: Completion-flag field format (Y/N? timestamp? composite?) not in inventory description; useful for spec-writer but not blocking flow analysis.
  - Related: [DATA-07]

## Review Checklist

Before approval, SME must validate:

- [X] Trigger model correctly identified — Scheduler + Batch
- [X] Business event name accurately reflects the business transaction — confirmed by Anna Chen (Finance Ops)
- [X] All nodes in scope — 4 programs, none missing, none extra
- [X] All edges reflect actual production calls
- [X] Cross-program data flow is complete — 7 data exchanges, all traced
- [X] Branch points capture user-visible decisions — all 3 RC-driven branches in CL
- [X] UI surfaces match production screens — N/A (batch)
- [ ] Error propagation matches operational reality — **partial-restart procedure documented, but in operational notes not in code** (see SEED-04)
- [X] Commit boundaries correctly identified — 3 boundaries, vulnerable windows flagged
- [X] Capability seeds are reasonable questions, not invented rules
- [X] All node program-analyses are approved

### SME Sign-Off

- **Reviewer:** [Anna Chen / Finance Ops — pending]
- **Review Date:** [Pending]
- **Decision:** draft → needs_sme_review
- **Notes:** Partial-restart procedure (SEED-04) is the key open item; rest of flow is well-evidenced.
