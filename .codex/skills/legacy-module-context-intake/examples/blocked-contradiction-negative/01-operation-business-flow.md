## Summary

Payment matching receives incoming bank payment files, looks up open invoices for
each payment, and posts matched amounts to the account receivable ledger. Unmatched
or partial payments are held in a suspense queue for manual review.

**This view is blocked pending resolution of RAG-CONFLICT-PAYMENT-MATCH-001.**
The matching frequency (daily EOD vs weekly batch) materially changes the business
flow and cannot be assumed.
