# Legacy Document Evidence Intake

## Skill Card

| Field | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Problem solved | Converts binary, scanned, or hard-to-read enterprise documents into consumable evidence files with coordinates and quality notes. |
| Input | Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Visio, PDF, images, screenshots, scanned docs, and source authorization context. |
| Output | Normalized Markdown / CSV / PDF / PNG / SVG files, manifests, quality gates, and redaction or blocked notes. |
| Core prompt strategy | Normalize formats first, preserve page/sheet/shape coordinates, flag unreadable or sensitive content, and avoid business-rule inference. |
| Upstream skill | `legacy-modernization-orchestrator` or direct user-provided raw document intake. |
| Downstream consumer | `legacy-flow-context-normalizer`, `legacy-module-context-intake`, or `legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake` when sensitivity is unresolved. |
| Validation standard | Every output file maps back to source coordinates, conversion warnings are explicit, and unauthorized production data is blocked. |
| Known risk | Losing evidence provenance during conversion or accidentally passing hidden PII/macros into downstream analysis. |
| Practical example | Convert a Visio process map and workbook tabs into Markdown/CSV plus a manifest before drafting module context. |

## Purpose

Turn historical business and technical documents that are trapped in formats
downstream skills cannot reliably read into a **normalized, evidence-coordinate
document-intake package**:

```text
00_context_packages/<MODULE-SLUG>/document-intake/<DOCSET-SLUG>/
|-- intake.manifest.yaml
|-- conversion-log.md
|-- extraction-quality.yaml
|-- extraction-warnings.md
|-- documents/
|   |-- <DOC-SLUG>/
|   |   |-- document.manifest.yaml
|   |   |-- normalized/        # .md, .csv, .pdf, .png, .svg outputs
|   |   `-- source/            # pointer/metadata to the authorized original
|   `-- ...
`-- evidence-coordinates.md
```

This skill is the **pre-normalization entry layer**. It makes legacy Excel,
Word, PowerPoint, Visio, PDF, image, screenshot, and scanned-document material
machine-consumable, records exactly how each artifact was converted or
extracted, and assigns evidence coordinates so that every fragment is traceable.

It does **not**:

- infer business rules, capabilities, or flows,
- generate BRD or spec content,
- approve evidence sensitivity or redaction,
- smooth over contradictions or pretend a failed conversion succeeded.

The next normal skill after a successful document intake is
`legacy-flow-context-normalizer`, which organizes evidence-bounded four-view
coverage, gaps, and SME questions from the normalized fragments produced here.

## Boundary

Use this skill **before** `legacy-flow-context-normalizer` when the source
material is still in raw Office / Visio / PDF / image form and has not been
converted to Markdown / CSV / PDF / PNG / SVG with manifests.

Do not use it as a replacement for:

- `legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake` — when sensitivity is unknown, source
  authorization is missing, production data is unapproved, or redaction is
  required. Route there first; this skill must not inspect unauthorized content.
- `legacy-flow-context-normalizer` — which owns four-view coverage
  organization, sparse-input triage, SME review questions, and
  `FRAG-*`/view classification. This skill only produces normalized format
  outputs and coordinates, not flow views or BRD facts.
- `legacy-module-context-intake` — which normalizes already-reviewed context
  or external RAG output.

This skill performs **format normalization and structural extraction only**.
If you find yourself classifying fragments into Operation / System / Program /
Data views or drawing flows, you are in the wrong skill.

## Supported Input Families

| Family | Extensions | Normalization Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Excel | `.xlsx`, `.xlsm`, `.xls` | Markdown tables + per-sheet CSV + structure manifest |
| Word | `.docx`, `.doc` | Markdown + extracted images |
| PowerPoint | `.pptx`, `.ppt` | Markdown (titles, text, notes) + slide PNG + optional PDF |
| Visio | `.vsdx`, `.vsd` | PDF / SVG / PNG export + shape-text Markdown + OCR/visual-review warnings |
| PDF | `.pdf` | Markdown text + tables (CSV) + page PNG |
| Images / screenshots / scanned docs | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.tif`, `.tiff`, `.bmp` | OCR Markdown + page PNG + low-confidence warnings |

See `references/format-strategy.md` for the per-format extraction and
conversion procedure, and `references/quality-gates.md` for the gate rubric.

## Required Inputs

- Module slug (`MODULE-SLUG`) and a document-set slug (`DOCSET-SLUG`).
- One or more source documents in a supported family. Readable exports are
  preferred; raw legacy binaries, scanned images, OCR-only material, and files
  needing converters are optional enhancements and may be skipped when tooling
  is unavailable. For each supplied document record:
  - source path,
  - declared file type,
  - file size,
  - `sha256` (or a recorded reason it could not be computed),
  - owner,
  - sensitivity (`public` / `internal` / `confidential` / `unknown`),
  - authorization status (`authorized` / `unauthorized` / `pending`).
- A statement of available conversion tooling (LibreOffice / `soffice`,
  Docling, OCR engine, PDF renderer) or an explicit "none available".

## Stop / Reroute Conditions

Stop and produce only blocking findings (gate `blocked`) if any apply:

| Condition | Route |
| --- | --- |
| Any source has `sensitivity: unknown` | `legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake` |
| Source authorization is missing or `unauthorized` | `legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake` |
| Production data sample is present and unapproved | `legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake` |
| Redaction is required and no approval is recorded | `legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake` |
| Module slug or document-set slug is missing | document owner clarification |
| No authorized readable content remains after optional binary/OCR/converter-dependent inputs are skipped | request a readable export / better tooling |

Missing conversion/OCR tooling is **not** a hard stop for the whole intake when
other authorized readable material exists. Register the affected document,
mark its `document_gate: blocked`, record `result: tool_unavailable`, add a
warning such as `skipped_optional_binary_unreadable`, and continue with the
readable documents. The package may still be `ready_with_warnings` if at least
one authorized document produced usable `FRAG-*` evidence. Only make the whole
package `blocked` when authorization/sensitivity blocks exist or every supplied
source is skipped/unreadable.

## Macro Security Policy (`.xlsm` and macro-enabled Office)

- `.xlsm` (and any macro-enabled Office file) must **never execute macros**.
- VBA / macro extraction is **static only** — read bytes, never run them.
- If macros are encrypted, password-protected, unavailable, or make external
  calls (network, shell, file-system, registry), mark
  `security_review_required: true` and do not treat extracted VBA as cleared.
- A macro-containing file gates at **`ready_with_warnings` at best** unless a
  named security reviewer has explicitly reviewed and signed off.
- If macro content is likely business logic but cannot be inspected, **block
  downstream promotion of that content as strong evidence**: record it as a
  `TBD-*` and mark its evidence coordinates `confidence: low,
  promotion: blocked`.

## Tooling / Docling Policy

- Binary conversion, OCR, image extraction, and legacy Office/Visio handling are
  optional enhancements. They must never be required for the hosted-agent path
  to continue when readable exports, Markdown, CSV, text, or normalized document
  packages are already available.
- **Enterprise/Copilot runtime rule**: do **not** create a Python virtual
  environment, install packages, or wait on interactive environment setup for
  this skill. Probe only tools that already exist in the runtime when the
  runtime is known to be prepared; otherwise record unavailable tools honestly
  in `conversion-log.md`. If a probe or interpreter startup remains in a
  configuring/evaluating state, stop using that tool for this run and record it
  as unavailable.
- **GitHub Copilot hosted-agent mode**: do not run Python commands, shell
  probes, package installs, virtual-environment setup, LibreOffice, OCR, or
  converter commands from this skill unless the user explicitly confirms the
  runtime is already prepared. Treat tooling as `tool_unavailable`, produce the
  manifests/warnings from readable supplied content, and report the manual
  validation/remediation command as text. Do not enter or wait on Python
  environment setup.
- The bundled validator is a standard-library Python script. Run it only with
  an already-available interpreter and never install dependencies for it. If no
  Python interpreter is available, record validation as `tool_unavailable`, keep
  the package gate `blocked`, and report the exact remediation.
- Optional converters/enhancers such as LibreOffice, OCR engines, PDF renderers,
  or Docling are never installed automatically. Missing optional tooling is
  evidence for the package gate, not a reason to stall.
- Deterministic structural extraction + manifests are the **canonical output**.
- Artifact preview guardrail: normalized Markdown, CSV, PDF, PNG, SVG, and OCR
  outputs are files to be indexed, not UI previews to be opened automatically.
  Do not open IDE, browser, image, PDF, or spreadsheet previews unless the user
  explicitly requests visual inspection. For large docsets or generated
  page/slide images, record `run_validation.artifact_preview_status:
  skipped_large_docset` and continue after structural validation. Never open
  every generated page/sheet/slide as a completion check, and never reopen the
  same preview repeatedly.
- Docling MAY be referenced as an optional renderer/enhancer for supported
  formats (`.xlsx`, `.docx`, `.pptx`, PDF). It must **not** be the only source
  of truth, and its output must be recorded as one extraction method among
  others, not as ground truth.
- Legacy binary formats (`.xls`, `.doc`, `.ppt`, `.vsd`) should be normalized
  first with LibreOffice / `soffice` (or another documented converter) before
  structural extraction:
  - `.xls` → `.xlsx`
  - `.doc` → `.docx`
  - `.ppt` → `.pptx` and/or PDF
  - `.vsd` → PDF / SVG / PNG
- If a converter is unavailable, record the gap in `conversion-log.md`, set the
  affected document gate to `blocked` (or `ready_with_warnings` when partial
  extraction still produced usable output), add a skip warning, and continue
  with other readable documents. Never record a conversion as successful when no
  tool ran.

## Output Contract

Use `references/quality-gates.md` for required fields. Start from the templates
under `templates/`. The package directory is:

```text
00_context_packages/<MODULE-SLUG>/document-intake/<DOCSET-SLUG>/
```

Required package-level files:

- `intake.manifest.yaml` — registry of every source document with path, type,
  size, `sha256`, owner, sensitivity, authorization status, conversion result,
  per-document gate, and the package-level gate decision.
- `conversion-log.md` — human-readable audit trail of every conversion and
  extraction attempt, the tool used (or "none available"), and the outcome.
- `extraction-quality.yaml` — per-document and per-fragment quality signals
  (extraction method, coverage, OCR confidence, macro findings, warnings).
- `extraction-warnings.md` — narrative list of warnings, security-review flags,
  visual-review needs, and low-confidence OCR regions.

Per-document files under `documents/<DOC-SLUG>/`:

- `document.manifest.yaml` — the single document's structure (sheets, sections,
  slides, pages, shapes), extracted outputs, and evidence coordinates.
- `normalized/` — the converted/normalized artifacts (`.md`, `.csv`, `.pdf`,
  `.png`, `.svg`).

The package-level **quality gate** in `intake.manifest.yaml` must be one of:

- `ready` — every document extracted cleanly; no macro/security flags; no
  unresolved authorization or sensitivity issues.
- `ready_with_warnings` — usable output exists, but some documents carry
  warnings (macros statically extracted, OCR low-confidence regions, visual
  review needed, partial conversion, optional binary skipped). Warnings travel
  forward.
- `blocked` — at least one hard issue (unauthorized/unknown sensitivity,
  required redaction missing, no tooling/readable export for every supplied
  document, or no document could be opened).

Allowed handoff:

- `ready` / `ready_with_warnings` → `legacy-flow-context-normalizer`
- `blocked` (authorization/sensitivity) → `legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake`
- `blocked` (tooling/readability) → request better export or tooling; record
  remediation in `extraction-warnings.md` and `intake.manifest.yaml`

## Evidence Coordinates

Every extracted fragment gets a stable coordinate so downstream skills can cite
exactly where a fact came from. Record them in each `document.manifest.yaml` and
summarize in `evidence-coordinates.md`.

| Format | Coordinate shape |
| --- | --- |
| Excel | workbook / sheet / row / column / cell-range |
| Word | section / heading / paragraph / table |
| PowerPoint | slide / shape / table / note |
| Visio | page / shape / connector / OCR-region |
| PDF | page / region / table |
| Image / scanned | page / OCR-region |

Mint `DOC-*` per source document and `FRAG-*` per extracted fragment, consistent
with `docs/id-conventions.md`. This skill does **not** mint `BR-*`, `CAP-*`,
`STEP-*`, `SYS-*`, `PGM-*`, or `DATA-*` — those belong to downstream skills.

## Step Contract

This skill conforms to the Legacy Spec Factory Step Contract. See
`../legacy-step-contract/references/step-contract.md` for field-level rules.

### Input

- **Required**: module slug, document-set slug, source document list with path,
  type, size, `sha256`, owner, sensitivity, and authorization status; declared
  available tooling.
- **Optional**: prior intake manifests to append to, known macro/scan flags,
  redaction approvals, Docling availability, preferred OCR engine.
- **Input readiness scoring**:
  - `0-5 blocked`: any source has `sensitivity: unknown`, missing
    authorization, unapproved production data, or required redaction without
    approval; or no document can be opened by any means.
  - `6 minimum_pass`: module/docset slugs, an authorized readable document set,
    and at least one extractable document are present; unknowns are TBDs.
  - `7-8 usable`: most documents convert/extract cleanly with sizes, hashes,
    and methods recorded; warnings are explicit.
  - `9-10 strong`: every document extracted with full structure, evidence
    coordinates, OCR confidence, and macro findings recorded; no unresolved
    authorization or sensitivity gaps.

### Execution

- **Procedure**: follow the Workflow below; per-format detail lives in
  `references/format-strategy.md`.
- **Allowed inference**: detecting file type from extension/header; choosing a
  documented converter; identifying sheets/sections/slides/pages/shapes;
  recording OCR text and confidence; statically listing VBA module names.
- **Forbidden assumptions**: executing macros; inventing content not present in
  the source; claiming a conversion ran when no tool was available; reading
  unauthorized or unknown-sensitivity content; classifying fragments into flow
  views; promoting macro logic to strong evidence without security review.
- **ID policy**: may mint `DOC-*`, `FRAG-*`, and `TBD-*`. Must not mint
  `BR-*`, `CAP-*`, `STEP-*`, `SYS-*`, `PGM-*`, or `DATA-*`.

### Output

- **Canonical directory**:
  `00_context_packages/<MODULE-SLUG>/document-intake/<DOCSET-SLUG>/`.
- **Required files**: `intake.manifest.yaml`, `conversion-log.md`,
  `extraction-quality.yaml`, `extraction-warnings.md`, `evidence-coordinates.md`,
  and one `document.manifest.yaml` per source document with its `normalized/`
  outputs.
- **Required gates**: authorization/sensitivity, conversion-honesty (no faked
  conversions), macro security, extraction quality, and no downstream
  inference.
- **Handoff status**: only `ready` and `ready_with_warnings` may feed
  `legacy-flow-context-normalizer`; warnings travel forward.

### Validation

- **Mechanical**: run the bundled validator (below). All required files exist;
  `intake.manifest.yaml` declares `package_type: document_evidence_intake`, a
  valid gate, and every document with required fields; the `outputs` index
  lists the required package files; every registered document has a matching
  `documents/<DOC-SLUG>/document.manifest.yaml`; and every non-blocked document
  output listed in `normalized_outputs` exists on disk.
- **Semantic**: no conversion is recorded as successful without a tool or a
  recorded fallback; every `.xlsm`/macro file carries macro findings and a
  security flag; unauthorized/unknown-sensitivity documents are not present in a
  `ready`/`ready_with_warnings` package; no flow-view classification or business
  rule appears.
- **Human approval**: a named reviewer signs off macro security review and any
  redaction decision before those documents are treated as cleared.
- **Blocking conditions**: unauthorized/unknown sensitivity, faked conversion,
  unexecuted-but-claimed extraction, missing macro security flag on a
  macro-enabled file, or any downstream inference.

Emit a Step Validation Report (see
`../legacy-step-contract/templates/step-validation-report.md`) with status
`pass`, `pass_with_warnings`, or `blocked` when reporting to the orchestrator.

## Workflow

1. **Resolve identity and tooling**
   - Confirm `MODULE-SLUG`, `DOCSET-SLUG`, and which converters/OCR/Docling are
     available. Record availability in `conversion-log.md`.
   - In GitHub Copilot hosted-agent mode, do not run shell probes. If prior
     runtime facts are not already visible, record converters/OCR/Python as
     `tool_unavailable` and continue with honest warnings or a blocked gate.
   - In an already-prepared local shell only, bounded PATH checks may be used.

2. **Register source files** (`intake.manifest.yaml`)
   - For each document record path, file type, size, `sha256`, owner,
     sensitivity, and authorization status. Mint a `DOC-*` ID.

3. **Gate authorization and sensitivity**
   - If any document has `sensitivity: unknown`, missing/`unauthorized`
     authorization, unapproved production data, or required-but-unapproved
     redaction, stop and route the package to `legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake`.
     Do not open that content.

4. **Normalize legacy binary formats**
   - Treat this as optional. Convert `.xls`→`.xlsx`, `.doc`→`.docx`,
     `.ppt`→`.pptx`/PDF, `.vsd`→PDF/SVG/PNG only when an approved converter is
     already available. If unavailable, register the document, record
     `tool_unavailable`, mark the document `blocked`, add a skip warning, and
     continue with other readable sources — never fake success.

5. **Extract structure** (per format, see `references/format-strategy.md`)
   - Excel: sheets (incl. hidden), used ranges, tables, formulas, merged cells,
     hyperlinks, cross-sheet references.
   - `.xlsm`: detect macros; never execute; statically extract VBA module names
     if tooling allows; set `security_review_required`.
   - Word: headings, paragraphs, tables, images, sections.
   - PowerPoint: slides, titles, text boxes, tables, speaker notes, embedded
     images, slide screenshots.
   - Visio: pages, shape text, connectors where available, visual exports,
     OCR/visual-review warnings.
   - PDF / image / scanned: page text, OCR (with confidence), tables, page
     images.

6. **Assign evidence coordinates**
   - Mint `FRAG-*` for each extracted fragment and record its format-specific
     coordinate in `document.manifest.yaml`; summarize in
     `evidence-coordinates.md`.

7. **Record quality and warnings**
   - Fill `extraction-quality.yaml` (method, coverage, OCR confidence, macro
     findings) and `extraction-warnings.md` (security flags, visual-review
     needs, low-confidence regions, partial conversions).

8. **Set the package gate**
   - `ready`, `ready_with_warnings`, or `blocked` per
     `references/quality-gates.md`.

9. **Validate**
   - In GitHub Copilot hosted-agent mode, do not run the bundled validator.
     Record `run_validation.structural_status:
     tool_unavailable_hosted_agent` in `intake.manifest.yaml`, keep the package
     out of downstream handoff, and report the manual validator path:
     `skills/legacy-document-evidence-intake/scripts/validate_document_intake_package.py`.
   - In an already-prepared local shell only, run the bundled validator with an
     existing Python interpreter and fix every finding before handoff. Record
     the result in `intake.manifest.yaml.run_validation`.
   - If no interpreter is available, do not create a virtual environment or
     install Python packages; record the validation tooling gap and keep the
     package `blocked` until validation can run.
   - Artifact preview status is informational only; it is not the validation
     gate. The gate is the manifest, normalized output file list, evidence
     coordinates, quality/warning files, and validator/manual structural
     review.

10. **Finalize and stop**
    - After `intake.manifest.yaml`, `conversion-log.md`,
      `extraction-quality.yaml`, `extraction-warnings.md`,
      `evidence-coordinates.md`, per-document manifests, normalized outputs,
      and `run_validation` status are written, stop the run and report the
      package path plus any manual validator or preview follow-up.
    - Do not keep re-reading the docset directory, repeatedly checking workflow
      status, or opening generated previews after write-back. Additional checks
      are allowed only when the validator returns a specific finding naming a
      file to fix.

## Handoff

After a `ready` / `ready_with_warnings` package is validated, run
`legacy-flow-context-normalizer` with:

- the normalized Markdown / CSV / PDF / PNG / SVG outputs,
- `intake.manifest.yaml` and `evidence-coordinates.md` (so `DOC-*` / `FRAG-*`
  IDs carry forward),
- `extraction-warnings.md` (so macro/OCR/visual-review warnings stay visible).

Tell the normalizer that any macro-derived content marked `promotion: blocked`
must not become strong evidence without security review, and that
low-confidence OCR fragments remain low-confidence until SME/source confirms.

## Adversarial Cases

- **Missing converter**: do not fake the conversion. Record "tool unavailable",
  set the document gate to `blocked` or `ready_with_warnings`, and provide
  remediation.
- **Macro-laden workbook**: never execute; statically list VBA; set
  `security_review_required: true`; cap at `ready_with_warnings`; block macro
  content from strong-evidence promotion.
- **Scanned/illegible page**: record OCR with low confidence and a
  visual-review warning; do not invent text for unreadable regions.
- **Unknown sensitivity / unauthorized**: route to
  `legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake`; do not open the content.
- **Contradictory documents**: record both; do not silently pick one. Carry the
  conflict forward as a `TBD-*` for the normalizer/SME.

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Every source document is registered with path, type, size, `sha256`,
  owner, sensitivity, and authorization status.
- ✅ Legacy binary formats are converted with a documented tool, or the gap is
  recorded honestly.
- ✅ Structure is extracted per format with evidence coordinates.
- ✅ Macro-enabled files carry static-only findings and a security flag.
- ✅ Quality gate is one of `ready`, `ready_with_warnings`, `blocked`.
- ✅ No business rules, flows, BRD/spec content, or approvals were produced.
- ✅ The validator passes before handoff to
  `legacy-flow-context-normalizer`.

## Version History

- v0.1.1 (2026-05-30): Added enterprise/Copilot runtime guardrails to prevent
  automatic Python environment creation or optional tool installation during
  document intake; missing tools must be recorded as package evidence instead
  of stalling.
- v0.1.2 (2026-05-31): Added an artifact preview guardrail and
  stop-after-writeback completion boundary so large document-intake packages do
  not remain in processing after normalized outputs and validation status are
  written.
- v0.1.0 (2026-05-29): Initial legacy document evidence intake and format
  normalization skill. Converts Excel / Word / PowerPoint / Visio / PDF / image
  / scanned documents into Markdown / CSV / PDF / PNG / SVG with manifests,
  evidence coordinates, and `ready` / `ready_with_warnings` / `blocked` quality
  gates. Static-only macro policy, honest-conversion policy, optional Docling
  as a non-canonical enhancer. Pre-normalization entry layer before
  `legacy-flow-context-normalizer`; routes unauthorized/unknown-sensitivity
  material to `legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake`.
