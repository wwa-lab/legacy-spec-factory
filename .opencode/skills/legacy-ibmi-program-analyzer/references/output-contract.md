## Entry Points & Parameters Section

```markdown
## Entry Points & Parameters

| Entry Point | Type | Parameters | Return | Evidence Strength |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MAIN | Main Program | (CustID: numeric, CreditAmt: decimal) | Result Code (0/1/-1) | confirmed_from_code |
| VALIDATECREDIT | Subroutine | (Amount: decimal, Limit: decimal) | Pass/Fail (1/0) | confirmed_from_code |

**Evidence links:**
- [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-001: Source header documentation]
- [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-002: RPGLE procedure specifications]

**Unresolved:**
- TBD-CREDIT-CHECK-001: Confirm MAIN parameter order matches call sites
```

**Requirements:**
- One table row per entry point (main program + callables)
- Columns: Entry Point name, Type (Main Program / Subroutine / Callable Procedure), Parameters (with types), Return value/status code, evidence strength
- Every parameter must be documented with direction (input/output/both) if visible in source
- Evidence links must reference EV-* IDs from inventory
- TBDs for undocumented or unclear contracts

**Evidence strength values:**
- `confirmed_from_code` — source header or procedure specification documents this
- `medium_confidence` — inferred from usage but not explicitly declared
- `needs_sme_review` — behavior visible but interpretation unclear

---

## Call Graph Section

This section captures **which subroutine/procedure calls which** — the structural skeleton of the program, independent of intra-procedure logic.

**Three required views:**

### View 1: Tree View (matches IBM i flow-header convention)

```markdown
### Tree View

Source: source-level flow header (lines 8–22) | derived-from-code | both (matched)

```text
Main line                    Main flow control
|-- SR990                    First time initialization
|-- SR995                    Re-initialization
|-- SR100                    Card, account and product preliminary validation
|    |-- SR110               Convert authorization amount to LCY/billing
|    |    |-- SR111          Convert transaction amount (LCY/billing)
|    |    |-- SR112          Convert auth amount (non-ATMP)
|    |    |-- SR113          Convert auth amount (ATMP)
|    |-- SR120               Extract track information
|    |-- SR121               Classify recurring transactions
|    |-- SR130               Validate CVV/CVC 1
```

Evidence: [EV-SLUG-NNN: source-level flow header lines 8–22] + [EV-SLUG-NNN: EXSR statements lines 145–890]
```

**Rules:**
- If the program has a source-level flow-header comment, reproduce it verbatim (with line numbers).
- If the code-derived graph matches the header, mark "both (matched)".
- If they differ, show both trees side-by-side and create a TBD.
- If no header exists, derive purely from code and mark "derived-from-code".

### View 2: Call Site Table

```markdown
### Call Sites

| Caller | Callee | Type | Line | Call Condition | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Main | SR990 | EXSR (internal) | 145 | first-time-only (LR off) | confirmed_from_code |
| Main | SR100 | EXSR (internal) | 152 | every call | confirmed_from_code |
| SR100 | SR110 | EXSR (internal) | 320 | always | confirmed_from_code |
| SR110 | SR111 | EXSR (internal) | 410 | currency = LCY | confirmed_from_code |
| SR110 | SR112 | EXSR (internal) | 422 | trans_type ≠ ATMP | confirmed_from_code |
| SR110 | SR113 | EXSR (internal) | 434 | trans_type = ATMP | confirmed_from_code |
| SR100 | UPDTRISK | CALL (external) | 520 | only if approved | confirmed_from_code |
```

**Required columns:**
- **Caller / Callee:** subroutine or program names
- **Type:** `EXSR (internal)`, `CALLP (internal)`, `CALL (external)`, `PERFORM (internal)`, `CALLPRC (external)`, etc.
- **Line:** source line of the call site
- **Call Condition:** when this call happens (`always`, `in DOWHILE loop`, `only if X`, `first-time only`, etc.) — derived from surrounding control flow
- **Evidence:** evidence strength + EV-* link

### View 3: Reverse Index

```markdown
### Reverse Index

| Subroutine | Called By | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SR990 | Main [line 145] | dead code after first call (LR-gated) |
| SR100 | Main [line 152] | hot path: called every invocation |
| SR110 | SR100 [line 320] | only callsite |
| SR111 | SR110 [line 410] | LCY branch only |
| SR112 | SR110 [line 422] | non-ATMP branch |
| SR113 | SR110 [line 434] | ATMP branch |
| (no callers) | — | dead subroutine (flag with TBD) |
```

**Why three views:**
- **Tree** → matches IBM i convention; SME can compare to source header at a glance.
- **Call Site Table** → captures *condition* of each call (the thing flow trees can't show).
- **Reverse Index** → exposes orphaned subroutines (declared but never called → dead code TBD) and hotspots (one subroutine called from many sites).

### Source-Level Flow Header Handling

If the source has a flow-header comment block (common in IBM i shops), the analyzer **must** reproduce it verbatim under "Tree View" and treat it as primary evidence (`confirmed_from_code`, source: flow header).

**Then** independently derive a call graph from code. Compare:

| Header vs. Code | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Match exactly | Tag `confirmed_from_code`; cite both sources. |
| Header has subroutine not in code | TBD: comment drift (likely subroutine renamed/removed) |
| Code has subroutine not in header | TBD: comment drift (likely subroutine added without updating header) |
| Header parent-child order differs from code | TBD: comment may reflect old structure |
| No header present | Derive from code only; note absence. |

---

## Control Flow Section

```markdown
## Control Flow

### Main Entry Point
1. Accept input parameters [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-001]
2. Call VALIDATECREDIT subroutine with (Amount, Limit) → [evidence_strength]
3. Branch on validation result:
   - If validation PASS (result = 1): proceed to step 4
   - If validation FAIL (result = 0): jump to step 5
4. Call CHECKEXPOSE program (Amount, CustID) → [evidence_strength]
   - If CHECKEXPOSE returns APPROVED: set result code = 1, go to step 6
   - If CHECKEXPOSE returns DENIED: set result code = -1, go to step 5
5. Write error message to QSYSOPR message queue, return result code
6. Return result code to caller

**Control structures:**
- Conditional: SELECT statement on validation result (lines 120–150)
- Loop: READE on CUSTFILE for validation iterations (lines 160–180)
- External call: CALLP CHECKEXPOSE (line 175)

**Evidence links:**
- [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-001: Source lines 100–210]

### VALIDATECREDIT Subroutine
1. Compare input Amount parameter vs. CREDLIMIT value from CREDFILE
2. If Amount ≤ CREDLIMIT: return 1 (pass)
3. Else: return 0 (fail)

**No error handling observed.** [evidence_strength: confirmed_from_code]
```

**Requirements:**
- Document main entry point control flow first, then each callable subroutine
- Use numbered steps with brief descriptions
- Identify control structures: conditionals, loops, external calls, error handling
- Tag evidence for each non-trivial step
- Note line numbers if available
- Create TBD for unclear branching logic or missing subroutines

**Format guidelines:**
- Steps should be executable (SME can predict program behavior from steps alone)
- Subroutine flow should be self-contained (independent of caller context)
- Loops and branches should show all paths (happy path + error paths)
- External calls should name the called program and parameters

---

## Object Dependencies Section

This section is the **flat reference inventory** — every external object the program touches, in one table. It matches the shop's `F5-OBJREF TREE` tool output so SMEs can compare side-by-side.

**Why this section exists separately from File I/O / External Calls:**
- Object Dependencies = **what is referenced** (flat list, all types)
- File I/O = **how files are read/written** (deep dive on PF/LF/DSPF/PRTF only)
- External Calls = **how programs are invoked** (deep dive on \*PGM / \*SRVPGM only)

An object listed in Object Dependencies that is a file should also appear in File I/O with operation details; if it is a called program, in External Calls. Data areas, copybooks, data structures appear only here.

### Format

```markdown
## Object Dependencies

Source: shop F5-OBJREF TREE tool output | derived-from-code | both (matched)

### Uses (forward dependencies)

| Object        | Type      | Version  | Description                                  | Inventory ID         | Evidence            |
| ---           | ---       | ---      | ---                                          | ---                  | ---                 |
| HSSDTAR002    | *DTAARA   | 01.00.00 | Batch Run Date-Related Parameters Data Area  | OBJ-AUTH-ONUS-014    | confirmed_from_code |
| HSSDTAR100    | *DTAARA   | —        | (description not in tool output)             | OBJ-AUTH-ONUS-015    | confirmed_from_code |

| HCCDTAR001    | Copybook  | —        | (D-spec include)                             | TBD-AUTH-ONUS-NNN    | confirmed_from_code |
| HCCDTAR115    | Copybook  | —        | (D-spec include)                             | TBD-AUTH-ONUS-NNN    | confirmed_from_code |
| CHECKEXPOSE   | *PGM      | —        | Credit exposure check (external program)     | OBJ-AUTH-ONUS-030    | confirmed_from_code |

### Used By (reverse dependencies)

Drawn from `01_inventory/inventory.yaml` `relationships` section.

| Caller      | Type   | Notes                              | Evidence                          |
| ---         | ---    | ---                                | ---                               |
| ORDENTR     | *PGM   | Calls CU101A on online auth flow   | from inventory relationships      |
| CU101B      | *PGM   | Calls CU101A after batch staging   | from inventory relationships      |
```

### Required Columns

| Column | Source / Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Object | Object name as it appears in source code (uppercase, IBM i naming) |
| Type | `PF`, `LF`, `DSPF`, `PRTF`, `*DTAARA`, `*DTAQ`, `*MSGF`, `*PGM`, `*SRVPGM`, `Copybook`, `PF (DS)` |
| Version | Shop-tracked version if available (e.g., `01.00.00`, `25.K.23A`); `—` if not tracked |
| Description | Business description from the shop tool, source comment, or inventory |
| Inventory ID | Matching `OBJ-*` from `01_inventory/inventory.yaml`; or `TBD-*` if inventory has no entry |
| Evidence | `confirmed_from_code` (F-spec, D-spec, /COPY, CALL statement) or `needs_sme_review` |

### Object-Type Recognition Hints

- **`H`-prefix** in shop conventions often = **header / D-spec include** (copybook); confirm against `/COPY` directives in source
- **`@`-prefix** often = **data-structure copybook** (parameter DS); confirm against `D` specs
- **`HSS`-prefix** in this shop = data areas (`HSSDTAR…` = SSDTAR data area family)
- **`HCC`-prefix** in this shop = copybooks (`HCCDTAR…` = CCDTAR family copybooks)
- These conventions are **shop-specific** — verify with the SME and add to a shop-conventions reference rather than hard-coding into the analysis.

### Inventory Cross-Check Rule

For every object in this table:
- If `01_inventory/inventory.yaml` has a matching `OBJ-*` → use that ID
- If not → create `TBD-<SLUG>-NNN: inventory gap, object [NAME] used by [PROGRAM] not in inventory`
  - Blocking: `pending_source` (inventory is incomplete)
  - This is a signal back to the inventory skill that its scope needs widening.

### Source Comparison Rule

If the shop's `F5-OBJREF TREE` output is provided as input:
- Reproduce its rows verbatim in the "Uses" table
- Independently re-derive the list from source code (F-specs, D-specs, /COPY directives, CALL statements)
- Mark "Source: both (matched)" if identical
- If shop tool has objects not in code or vice versa → create TBD (tool drift / dead reference / missing source)

## File I/O Section

```markdown
## File I/O

| File | Type | Operations | Key Fields | Purpose | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CREDFILE | PF | CHAIN | CUSTID | Fetch credit profile | [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-002] |
| CUSTFILE | LF | READE | CUSTID | Iterate customer records for validation | [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-003] |
| LIMITTBL | PF | SETLL, READE | COUNTRY, CATEGORY | Lookup credit limit by country/category | [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-004] |

**Operation details:**

- **CREDFILE / CHAIN on CUSTID:** Fetch entire customer credit record. Key field: CUSTID (numeric). Result: populated *IN99 (not found indicator).
- **CUSTFILE / READE on CUSTID:** Loop through all customer records matching CUSTID. Continue until EOF or error.
- **LIMITTBL / SETLL + READE:** Locate and read limit table by (COUNTRY, CATEGORY). If SETLL finds no match, skip READE.

**Evidence links:**
- [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-002: DB2 for i table definitions]
- [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-003: RPGLE F-specs and I/O statements]

**Unresolved:**
- TBD-CREDIT-CHECK-002: Confirm whether CUSTFILE includes historical records or active only
```

**Requirements:**
- One table row per file accessed
- Columns: File name, Type (PF / LF / DSPF / PRTF), Operations (SETLL, READE, CHAIN, WRITE, UPDATE, DELETE), Key fields, Purpose, Evidence link
- For each operation, document:
  - Key fields used in access (e.g., CHAIN on CUSTID)
  - Indicators set (e.g., *IN99 for not found)
  - Expected record count or iteration scope
- Reference file definitions from inventory (EV-*)
- Tag evidence as `confirmed_from_code` or `needs_sme_review`
- Create TBD for missing DDS, unclear key fields, or undocumented access patterns

## External Calls Section

```markdown
## External Calls

| Called Program | Type | Parameters (In / Out) | Purpose | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GETRATE | RPGLE Service Program | (RateCode: char) → (Rate: decimal) | Fetch interest rate by code | [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-005] |
| CHECKEXPOSE | RPGLE Program | (Amount: decimal, CustID: numeric) → (Decision: char) | Check credit exposure limits | [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-006] |
| UPDATEJNL | COBOL Program | (JournalCode: char, Timestamp: timestamp) → (RC: numeric) | Write to audit journal | [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-007] |

**Call details:**

- **GETRATE:** CALLP GETRATE(RateCode), returns RATE field. Error handling: if call fails, MONITOR catches and logs error.
- **CHECKEXPOSE:** CALL CHECKEXPOSE (Amount, CustID, Decision). Synchronous, blocks until return.
- **UPDATEJNL:** CALL 'UPDATEJNL' (JournalCode, Timestamp, RC). Called only if audit flag is set.

**Parameter contracts:**
- GETRATE expects RateCode to match RATE_TABLE key (uppercase, 3 chars). Undocumented → TBD-CREDIT-CHECK-003
- CHECKEXPOSE returns Decision: 'A' (approved), 'D' (denied), 'U' (unknown). Confirmed from source comments.
- UPDATEJNL RC values: 0 (success), 1 (journal full), -1 (system error). Confirmed from called program documentation.

**Unresolved:**
- TBD-CREDIT-CHECK-003: Confirm GETRATE parameter validation and error codes
- TBD-CREDIT-CHECK-004: Confirm CHECKEXPOSE network timeout behavior (call fails or returns default?)
```

**Requirements:**
- One table row per external call (program call, service program call, remote interface)
- Columns: Called program/interface name, Type (RPGLE Program / CLLE Program / Service Program / HTTP API / Message Queue / etc.), Parameters with types (In/Out), Purpose, Evidence
- For each call, document:
  - Parameter types and expected ranges
  - Return value or status code
  - Synchronous vs. asynchronous
  - Error handling (if monitored)
  - When the call is made (conditional or always)
- Reference evidence links (EV-*)
- Tag evidence as `confirmed_from_code` or `needs_sme_review`
- Create TBD for undocumented parameters, missing documentation, or unclear network behavior

---

## Error Handling Section

```markdown
## Error Handling

| Error Condition | Detected By | Handling | Recovery | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| File not found (CREDFILE) | MONITOR block (lines 200–210) | Write error message to QSYSOPR | Return -1 (error code) | [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-008] |
| Program not found (GETRATE) | CALL exception (CPDA error) | Log to error queue, skip rate lookup | Use default rate = 0, continue | [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-009] |
| Unexpected amount (< 0) | IF statement (line 115) | Write validation error | Return 0 (denied) | [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-010] |
| No records found (READE EOF) | SETOF indicator (lines 160–180) | Exit loop, proceed to next step | No error, expected path | [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-011] |

**Unhandled exceptions:**
- CUSTFILE READE fails with I/O error: no MONITOR block → Program will abnormally terminate → TBD-CREDIT-CHECK-005: Confirm error handling intent

**Logged errors:**
- Error messages written to QSYSOPR (message queue)
- Error codes logged if UPDATEJNL succeeds
- No persistent error table observed

**Evidence links:**
- [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-008: RPGLE MONITOR blocks]
- [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-009: CALL error handling]
```

**Requirements:**
- One table row per monitored error condition
- Columns: Error condition (what goes wrong), Detected by (MONITOR block / IF statement / indicator check / etc.), Handling (what code does), Recovery (result for caller), Evidence
- Separate section for unhandled exceptions (errors NOT caught)
- Note which errors log messages and where
- Reference evidence links
- Tag evidence strength
- Create TBD for unclear error codes, missing error handling, or context-dependent behavior

---

## TBDs & Blocking Status Section

```markdown
## TBDs & Blocking Status

### Pending Source
- **TBD-CREDIT-CHECK-002:** Confirm CUSTFILE includes historical records or active only
  - Blocking: pending_source — missing CUSTFILE DDS field documentation
  - Related: [OBJ-CREDIT-CHECK-001], [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-003]

### Pending SME Judgment
- **TBD-CREDIT-CHECK-001:** Confirm MAIN parameter order matches call sites
  - Blocking: pending_sme_judgment — source header ambiguous
  - Related: [EV-CREDIT-CHECK-001]

- **TBD-CREDIT-CHECK-003:** Confirm GETRATE parameter validation and error codes
  - Blocking: pending_sme_judgment — external program undocumented
  - Related: [OBJ-CREDIT-CHECK-005]

- **TBD-CREDIT-CHECK-005:** Confirm error handling intent for CUSTFILE I/O failures
  - Blocking: pending_sme_judgment — unhandled exception possible
  - Related: [OBJ-CREDIT-CHECK-001]

### Non-Blocking
- **TBD-CREDIT-CHECK-004:** Confirm CHECKEXPOSE network timeout behavior
  - Blocking: non_blocking — call has error handling, timeout path defined
  - Related: [OBJ-CREDIT-CHECK-006]
```

**Requirements:**
- Group TBDs by blocking status:
  - `pending_source` — missing DDS, incomplete source
  - `pending_sme_judgment` — behavior unclear from source alone
  - `non_blocking` — known gaps that don't affect downstream analysis
- For each TBD, include:
  - Question statement
  - Blocking status
  - Related object/evidence IDs
- No TBD should be vague ("something is unclear")
- Every TBD must map to a concrete gap or ambiguity

- Decision: approved | approved_with_non_blocking_tbd | rejected
- Notes: [free-form]
```

## Evidence Strength Taxonomy

Every claim (entry point, control flow step, file I/O, external call, error handling) must carry one evidence strength:

| Strength | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `confirmed_from_code` | Source code directly shows this (visible in procedure spec, F-spec, I/O statement, MONITOR block) | RPGLE procedure header declares parameter types |
| `medium_confidence` | Inferred from usage pattern but not explicitly declared (e.g., indicator logic implies condition) | A field is assigned only in one IF branch → likely purpose of the field |
| `strongly_inferred` | Multiple evidence points support this (call site + default behavior) | External call always preceded by data validation → likely required validation |
| `needs_sme_review` | Evidence present but interpretation ambiguous (multiple possible meanings) | Error code returned but undocumented; could mean multiple things |
| `missing` | Evidence required but not available (DDS missing, source incomplete) | File accessed but DDS not in inventory → TBD |

---

## Review Status Values

- **draft** — initial analysis, ready for SME review
- **needs_sme_review** — waiting for SME validation (has blocking TBDs or ambiguities)
- **approved** — SME confirmed all behaviors and resolved TBDs
- **approved_with_non_blocking_tbd** — SME approved despite non-blocking TBDs (e.g., undocumented call without impact on this program's behavior)
- **rejected** — SME found serious errors or inconsistencies
