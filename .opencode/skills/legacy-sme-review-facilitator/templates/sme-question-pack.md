## Instructions for SME

This document contains questions compiled from the artifact under review. For
each question:

1. **Read the question and context** (including evidence strength and prior
   claims)
2. **Reply in chat with the target ID and your choice** (for example:
   `BR-001 confirm` or `VAL-004 needs evidence`)
3. **Confirm or revise** any inferences or claims
4. **Note any caveats** or conditions
5. **Mark decision outcome** (confirmed / rejected / deferred / etc.)

All answers will be recorded in the decision log with your name, role, and date.
AI suggestions are prefilled only to reduce review effort; they are not SME
approval until you confirm or revise them.

**Position A (from evidence):**
> [First observed behavior or rule]
> Evidence: `EV-<CAPABILITY>-NNN` (source, strength)

**Position B (from evidence):**
> [Second observed behavior or rule]
> Evidence: `EV-<CAPABILITY>-NNN` (source, strength)
