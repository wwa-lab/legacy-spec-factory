# Step Validation Report — Inventory For Credit Check (Blocked, SME Owner Missing)

## Header

- **step_id:** `STEP-CREDIT-CHECK-002`
- **skill:** `legacy-ibmi-inventory`
- **capability_slug:** `CREDIT-CHECK`
- **executed_by:** example agent (INPUT pre-flight only; workflow did not execute)
- **executed_at:** 2026-05-14 09:42 UTC
- **contract_block:** `skills/legacy-step-contract/examples/inventory-blocked/step-contract-block.md`
- **artifacts_produced:** none (step blocked at INPUT)

## Compact Validation Result

```yaml
status: blocked
step_id: STEP-CREDIT-CHECK-002
blocking_items:
  - TBD-CREDIT-CHECK-010
warnings: []
sme_decision: pending
downstream_next_step: none
remediation_step: legacy-ibmi-inventory
```

## 1. Mechanical Validation

| Check | Result | Evidence / Tool | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| INPUT pre-flight: `sme_owner` present when `sme_required = yes` | **fail** | contract block, INPUT section | sole blocker |
| Required files exist | n/a | step did not execute | no artifacts produced |
| Schema validates | n/a | step did not execute | no `inventory.yaml` |
| ID prefixes match `docs/id-conventions.md` | n/a | step did not execute | no minted IDs |
| No dangling references | n/a | step did not execute | nothing to reference |
| Sensitivity resolved | pass | linter on INPUT scope | all evidence `sensitive: redacted` |
| Status fields in enum | n/a | step did not execute | no artifact statuses |
| Every claim has linked evidence | n/a | step did not execute | no claims |
| Forbidden tools not used | n/a | step did not execute | no tool calls |
| ID minting policy respected | n/a | step did not execute | nothing minted |
| Non-outputs absent | n/a | step did not execute | no outputs at all |

**Mechanical verdict:** `blocked` (INPUT pre-flight failure short-circuits
downstream mechanical checks).

## 2. AI Semantic Review

| Check | Finding | Blocking? | Linked IDs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claims match evidence | not applicable; no claims produced | n/a | n/a |
| Knowledge type matches claim shape | not applicable; no claims produced | n/a | n/a |
| Evidence strength not overstated | not applicable; no claims produced | n/a | n/a |
| No invented facts | not applicable; no claims produced | n/a | n/a |
| No scope creep | not applicable; no claims produced | n/a | n/a |
| TBDs explicit | yes — missing SME is explicitly tracked | no | TBD-CREDIT-CHECK-010 |
| Contradictions surfaced | not applicable; no claims produced | n/a | n/a |

**Semantic verdict:** `not_evaluated` — AI semantic review is meaningful
only against produced artifacts. No false-positive "semantic pass" is
emitted while the step is blocked.

## 3. SME / Human Approval

| Check | Required? | Approved By | Date | IDs Approved | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Object coverage approved | yes | unassigned | n/a | n/a | **blocked** |
| Inferred business rules approved | no | n/a | n/a | n/a | not_required |
| Modernization decisions approved | no | n/a | n/a | n/a | not_required |
| Behavior intentionality approved | no | n/a | n/a | n/a | not_required |
| TBD blocking/non-blocking decision | yes | unassigned | n/a | n/a | **blocked** |
| Spec promotion to `approved` | no | n/a | n/a | n/a | not_required |
| Forward handoff approved | no | n/a | n/a | n/a | not_required |

**SME verdict:** `blocked` — `sme_required: yes` but no Credit Operations
SME assigned. Per `references/step-contract.md` line 192, SME absence at a
step that requires SME is itself a blocker.

## 4. Unresolved Items Ledger

```yaml
unresolved_items:
  - id: TBD-CREDIT-CHECK-010
    category: sme_questions
    points_to:
      - skills/legacy-step-contract/examples/inventory-blocked/step-contract-block.md:INPUT.sme_owner
      - 01_inventory/inventory.yaml:sme_review.sme_owner
    resolver: sme
    blocks_current_step: yes
    blocks_next_step: yes
    notes: >-
      Credit Operations SME owner has not been assigned. Capability owner
      identifies the right SME and records the role in `sme_owner`. Once
      recorded, the inventory runner re-enters INPUT pre-flight; this
      validation report is then superseded by a fresh run of
      `legacy-step-validator`.
```

## 5. Handoff Note

- **Next step in chain:** none — `legacy-ibmi-program-analyzer` MUST NOT
  be invoked against `CAP-CREDIT-CHECK-001` while this step is blocked.
- **What carries forward:** nothing; no `OBJ-*`, no `BEH-*`, no `BR-*`,
  no produced `TBD-*` beyond the blocker itself.
- **Warnings carried forward:** none (status is `blocked`, not
  `pass_with_warnings`).
- **Gate impact:** Inventory Completeness Gate cannot be evaluated;
  treat as failing until step exits `blocked`.
