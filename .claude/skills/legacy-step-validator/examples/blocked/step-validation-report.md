# Step Validation Report — CARD-AUTH Module Analysis

## Header

- **report_path:** `06_quality/step-validation-report.md`
- **findings_path:** `06_quality/blocking-findings.yaml`
- **validator_skill:** `legacy-step-validator` v0.1.0
- **step_type:** `module`
- **step_id:** `STEP-CARD-AUTH-002`
- **package_path:** `04_modules/CARD-AUTH/`

## Compact Result

```yaml
status: blocked
step_id: STEP-CARD-AUTH-002
step_type: module
blocking_items:
  - FIND-CARD-AUTH-001
  - FIND-CARD-AUTH-002
  - FIND-CARD-AUTH-003
  - FIND-CARD-AUTH-004
warnings: []
sme_decision: pending
downstream_next_step: none
remediation_step: legacy-ibmi-flow-analyzer
report_path: 06_quality/step-validation-report.md
findings_path: 06_quality/blocking-findings.yaml
```

`remediation_step` is the prerequisite the user must complete before
re-running this validator. `downstream_next_step` stays `none` while
the package is blocked.

## Pre-flight

| Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No `sensitivity: unknown` in evidence | pass | inventory.yaml has none |
| No raw production PII / financial detail outside authorized samples | pass | samples are authorized or masked |
| Source-path authorization or required redaction approval exists for every `EV-*` | pass | evidence manifest lists each EV-* |
| ID prefixes conform to `docs/id-conventions.md` | pass | linter |
| All cross-referenced IDs resolve | **fail** | `03-program-flow.md` references `FLOW-CHARGEBACK-001` which has no approved `flow-*.md` |
| Knowledge type labels within allowed enum | pass | linter |
| Evidence strength labels within allowed enum | pass | linter |

One non-redaction pre-flight row fails. The status is locked to `blocked`,
but advisory semantic and SME-readiness findings are still collected because
the redaction checks passed.

## 1. Mechanical Layer

| Check | Result | Evidence / Tool | Dimension |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `module-overview.md` present with required sections | pass | filesystem | 3 |
| Default module package files present | pass | filesystem | 3 |
| `module-review-checklist.md` present | pass | filesystem | 3 |
| IDs minted are restricted to allowed prefixes | pass | linter | 3 |
| Every in-scope flow is `approved` or `approved_with_non_blocking_tbd` | **fail** | `FLOW-CHARGEBACK-001` is `blocked_pending_sme` | 1 |

Mechanical verdict: **blocked**

## 2. AI Semantic Layer

| Check | Finding | Blocking? | Linked IDs | Dimension |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cross-flow synthesis matches the flow analyses | View 3 cites a node from the unapproved `FLOW-CHARGEBACK-001` | yes | NODE-CHARGEBACK-002 | 2 |
| Source-backed context notes map to Program/Data evidence or carry named TBDs | Module overview names "Settlement Operator" but Program Flow has no mapped code path or manual-only tag | yes | TBD-CARD-AUTH-003 | 2 |
| Every Data Flow object traces to a flow in Program Flow | pass | — | 2 |
| Tier-2 SME claims contradicting tier-1 code surfaced as TBDs | One SME claim ("we no longer use the IFS drop path") contradicts code in `RPG2` but no TBD surfaces this | yes | TBD-CARD-AUTH-007 (missing) | 9 |
| Capability seeds remain questions | pass | seeds phrased as questions | 5 |
| BAU rhythm / regulatory / manual procedures come from SME | pass | cited from BAU notes | 4 |

Semantic verdict: **blocked**

## 3. SME Readiness Layer

| Check | Result | Recorded SME role / date / IDs | Dimension |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Module overview, Program Flow, and Data Flow name expected reviewers | pass | overview: business owner; Program Flow: dev lead; Data Flow: data analyst | 6 |
| Evidence-view review checklist present | pass | Program Flow and Data Flow review rows | 6 |
| Module-level review checklist present | pass | `module-review-checklist.md` | 6 |
| SME approval recorded for any view that claims `approved` | **fail** | `04-data-flow.md` claims `approved` but no SME role / date / IDs recorded | 6 |

SME readiness verdict: **not_ready**

## Findings by Review Dimension

### 1. Input readiness

| Finding ID | Severity | Layer | Points to | Resolver | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FIND-CARD-AUTH-001 | blocking | mechanical | `04_modules/CARD-AUTH/03-program-flow.md`; `FLOW-CHARGEBACK-001` | runner | Route `FLOW-CHARGEBACK-001` back to `legacy-ibmi-flow-analyzer` and either remove it from this module's scope or wait until it is `approved`. |

### 2. Execution traceability

| Finding ID | Severity | Layer | Points to | Resolver | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FIND-CARD-AUTH-002 | blocking | semantic | `module-overview.md`; `TBD-CARD-AUTH-003`; `03-program-flow.md` | runner | Mark "Settlement Operator" as source-backed manual context with SME evidence, or add a Program Flow entry / TBD if it is expected to map to code. |

### 3. Output contract completeness

| Finding ID | Severity | Layer | Points to | Resolver | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none |  |  |  |  |  |

### 4. Evidence integrity

| Finding ID | Severity | Layer | Points to | Resolver | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none |  |  |  |  |  |

### 5. Knowledge taxonomy correctness

| Finding ID | Severity | Layer | Points to | Resolver | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none |  |  |  |  |  |

### 6. SME review readiness

| Finding ID | Severity | Layer | Points to | Resolver | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FIND-CARD-AUTH-003 | blocking | sme_readiness | `04_modules/CARD-AUTH/04-data-flow.md` | sme | Either record SME role, date, and IDs approved, or revert `status` to `in_review`. |

### 7. Downstream handoff readiness

| Finding ID | Severity | Layer | Points to | Resolver | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none |  |  |  |  |  |

### 8. Open TBD handling

| Finding ID | Severity | Layer | Points to | Resolver | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none |  |  |  |  |  |

### 9. Contradiction / missing evidence detection

| Finding ID | Severity | Layer | Points to | Resolver | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FIND-CARD-AUTH-004 | blocking | semantic | `module-overview.md`; RPG2 source via `program-analysis-OBJ-CARD-AUTH-005.md` | sme | Surface the SME-vs-code disagreement on the IFS drop path as a new `TBD-CARD-AUTH-007` (`category: contradictory_evidence`) and route to SME to resolve. |

### 10. Redaction and sensitivity safety

| Finding ID | Severity | Layer | Points to | Resolver | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none |  |  |  |  |  |

## Unresolved Items Ledger

```yaml
unresolved_items:
  - id: TBD-CARD-AUTH-007
    category: contradictory_evidence
    points_to:
      - 04_modules/CARD-AUTH/module-overview.md
      - program-analysis-OBJ-CARD-AUTH-005.md
    resolver: sme
    blocks_current_step: yes
    blocks_next_step: yes
    notes: "SME claim 'IFS drop path is retired' contradicts active code path in RPG2. Either the code is dead or the SME memory is stale; SME decision required."
```

## Handoff Note

- **Next step in chain:** none (this validation is `blocked`).
- **What carries forward:** the three blocking findings above plus
  the new `TBD-CARD-AUTH-007`.
- **Warnings carried forward:** none.
- **Gate impact:** module-analyzer cannot promote past
  `approved_with_non_blocking_tbd`; spec-writer must not run on this
  module until the blockers clear.
