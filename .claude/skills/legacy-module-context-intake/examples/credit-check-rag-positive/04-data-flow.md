## Summary

`CREDITVW` exposes `CUSTNO`, `STATUS`, and `AVAIL_CREDIT`. The logical file is
based on `CUSTMAST`, whose physical fields include `CUSTNO`, `STATUS`,
`CRDLMT`, and `USEDAMT`. The supplied DDS does not prove how `AVAIL_CREDIT` is
derived, so the derivation remains open for data owner review.
