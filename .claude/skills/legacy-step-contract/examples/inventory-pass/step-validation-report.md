## Compact Validation Result

```yaml
status: pass
step_id: STEP-CREDIT-CHECK-001
blocking_items: []
warnings: []
sme_decision: approved
downstream_next_step: legacy-ibmi-program-analyzer
remediation_step: none
```

## 1. Mechanical Validation

| Check | Result | Evidence / Tool | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Required files exist | pass | filesystem | three inventory artifacts present |
| Schema validates | n/a | no formal inventory schema yet | output-contract checklist used |
| ID prefixes match `docs/id-conventions.md` | pass | linter | only `OBJ-*`, `EV-*`, `TBD-*`, `STEP-*` |
| No dangling references | pass | linter | all `evidence_ids[]` resolve |
| Sensitivity resolved | pass | linter | no `sensitive: unknown` |
| Status fields in enum | pass | review | `sme_review.decision: approved` |
| Every claim has linked evidence | pass | linter | all objects and relationships have `EV-*` |
| Forbidden tools not used | pass | runner note | no raw evidence read |
| ID minting policy respected | pass | linter | no business-rule IDs minted |
| Non-outputs absent | pass | filesystem | no `spec.yaml`, Java, or `BR-*` output |

**Mechanical verdict:** `pass`

## 2. AI Semantic Review

| Check | Finding | Blocking? | Linked IDs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claims match evidence | Object inventory matches the supplied source, DDS, and spool sample list | no | OBJ-CREDIT-CHECK-001..009 |
| Knowledge type matches claim shape | Inventory observations do not promote business rules | no | n/a |
| Evidence strength not overstated | Source and spool evidence strengths match the taxonomy | no | EV-CREDIT-CHECK-001..004 |
| No invented facts | No unsupported object, field, or report appears | no | n/a |
| No scope creep | Inventory remains within credit-check capability | no | CAP-CREDIT-CHECK-001 |
| TBDs explicit | Two open SME questions are carried as non-blocking | no | TBD-CREDIT-CHECK-001..002 |
| Contradictions surfaced | No contradictory evidence found | no | n/a |

**Semantic verdict:** `pass`

## 3. SME / Human Approval

| Check | Required? | Approved By | Date | IDs Approved | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Object coverage approved | yes | Credit Operations SME | 2026-05-13 | OBJ-CREDIT-CHECK-001..009 | approved |
| Inferred business rules approved | no | n/a | n/a | n/a | not_required |
| Modernization decisions approved | no | n/a | n/a | n/a | not_required |
| Behavior intentionality approved | no | n/a | n/a | n/a | not_required |
| TBD blocking/non-blocking decision | yes | Credit Operations SME | 2026-05-13 | TBD-CREDIT-CHECK-001..002 | approved_with_non_blocking_tbd |
| Spec promotion to `approved` | no | n/a | n/a | n/a | not_required |
| Forward handoff approved | no | n/a | n/a | n/a | not_required |

**SME verdict:** `approved`
