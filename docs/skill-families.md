# Skill Families

Legacy Spec Factory has 22 skills. They are not equally connected — some are
called every run, some only at boundaries, some only when reviewing. This
document groups them into **families** so callers (humans and orchestrators)
know which skills travel together, which order they fire in, and which
shared vocabulary they use.

**Authoritative status / scores**: see
[`skill-status-truth-table.md`](skill-status-truth-table.md). This document
is about **how skills relate**, not whether they are field-pilot ready.

## Family Overview

| Family | Skills | When They Fire |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Routing | 1 | At any decision point — picks the next skill |
| Module-first context intake | 2 | Default enterprise entry path when scattered documents, external RAG / code-knowledge-graph output, or four-view module context enters the repo |
| Layer 1 — IBM i extraction | 8 | Selective verification path when source evidence is missing, conflicting, or high risk |
| Layer 2 — synthesis | 3 | After module context or Layer 1 evidence is approved |
| Bridge / handoff | 2 | After synthesis is approved |
| Governance | 5 | Cross-cutting; called by other skills |
| Verification | 1 | Before cutover / parallel-run |
| **Total** | **22** | |

---

## 1. Routing

**Purpose**: Identify the current pipeline stage, the next safest skill, and
the gates that must pass first. Never produces business artifacts.

| Skill | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [`legacy-modernization-orchestrator`](../skills/legacy-modernization-orchestrator/SKILL.md) | Stateless router; reads the user's situation and emits `(stage, next_skill, gate_status)` |

**Typical call**: every time a user asks "what should I do next?" or "is this
ready for the next step?"

**Important**: the orchestrator does NOT execute downstream skills. It tells
the user (or wrapping agent) which skill to invoke next.

---

## 1A. Module-First Context Intake

**Purpose**: Normalize scattered historical documentation and external RAG /
code-knowledge-graph output into a traceable package before module analysis.
This is the default enterprise entry path when a team already has Visio, Word,
Excel, PDF, PowerPoint, RAG output, four reviewed flows, or a module-level
context package. It does not replace evidence authorization or SME approval.

| Skill | Reads | Writes | Position |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`legacy-flow-context-normalizer`](../skills/legacy-flow-context-normalizer/SKILL.md) | scattered Visio / Word / Excel / PDF / PowerPoint / RAG / SME-note documentation that is not yet four-flow reviewed | `00_context_packages/<MODULE-SLUG>/flow-normalization/` | Before SME review and before `legacy-module-context-intake` when four-view context is not yet confirmed |
| [`legacy-module-context-intake`](../skills/legacy-module-context-intake/SKILL.md) | RAG bundle, source snippets, dictionary mappings, contradictions, retrieval gaps, four-view module notes | `00_context_packages/<MODULE-SLUG>/` | Before `legacy-ibmi-module-analyzer` in module-first runs |

**Sequence**:

```text
scattered docs / draft flow evidence
  └─ flow-context-normalizer
       └─ SME review
            └─ module-context-intake
external RAG bundle + human-confirmed module context
  └─ module-context-intake
       └─ module-analyzer (validates / synthesizes approved 4-view module)
```

**Anti-pattern**: treating draft document-derived flow steps or RAG candidates
as approved `BR-*` rules. Flow normalization and context intake preserve
candidates and gaps; downstream SME review decides what can be promoted.

---

## 2. Layer 1 — IBM i Extraction / Selective Verification

**Purpose**: Read raw IBM i artifacts (RPGLE, CLLE, COBOL, DDS, jobs, screens,
reports) and produce structured, evidence-tagged extraction output. Every
Layer 1 skill respects the same anti-hallucination rules: code is ground
truth (tier 1), SME knowledge is tier 2/3, prior wikis are tier 4.

In the module-first operating model, Layer 1 is not the default path for every
run. Use these skills selectively when RAG output is incomplete, when a human
flow conflicts with code/ARCAD/dictionary evidence, when the module boundary is
unclear, or when a high-risk rule needs source-level verification.

| Skill | Reads | Writes | Position |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake`](../skills/legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake/SKILL.md) | raw evidence bundles | `evidence/manifest.yaml`, `redaction-log.md` | **First** — gates everything else |
| [`legacy-ibmi-inventory`](../skills/legacy-ibmi-inventory/SKILL.md) | approved evidence + source listings | `01_inventory/inventory.yaml`, object map | After intake |
| [`legacy-ibmi-runtime-evidence-miner`](../skills/legacy-ibmi-runtime-evidence-miner/SKILL.md) | approved job logs / spool files + inventory mappings | `runtime-evidence.jsonl`, mining checklist | After intake + inventory; parallel evidence enrichment |
| [`legacy-ibmi-program-analyzer`](../skills/legacy-ibmi-program-analyzer/SKILL.md) | one program (RPGLE/CLLE/COBOL) | `program-analysis-<OBJ-ID>.md` | Once per program in inventory |
| [`legacy-ibmi-flow-analyzer`](../skills/legacy-ibmi-flow-analyzer/SKILL.md) | multiple program-analyses for one transaction | `flow-<FLOW-SLUG>.md` | After per-program analysis is done |
| [`legacy-ibmi-module-analyzer`](../skills/legacy-ibmi-module-analyzer/SKILL.md) | related flows | `04_modules/<MODULE-SLUG>/` (4-view) | After flows for a capability are done |
| [`legacy-ibmi-data-model-analyzer`](../skills/legacy-ibmi-data-model-analyzer/SKILL.md) | DDS PF/LF + related programs | `03_data_models/<DATA-SLUG>/` | Parallel to program/flow analysis |
| [`legacy-ibmi-screen-report-analyzer`](../skills/legacy-ibmi-screen-report-analyzer/SKILL.md) | DSPF/PRTF + driving programs | `screen-report-analysis-<OBJ-ID>.md` | Parallel to program/flow analysis |

**Sequence**:

```
evidence-intake (gate)
  ├─ inventory
  │    ├─ runtime-evidence-miner (optional but recommended where logs/spool exist)
  │    ├─ program-analyzer (per program)
  │    │    └─ flow-analyzer (per transaction flow)
  │    ├─ data-model-analyzer (per data subject)
  │    └─ screen-report-analyzer (per UI/report surface)

targeted findings
  └─ context package / module-analyzer evidence repair
```

**Shared vocabulary**: `OBJ-*`, `EV-*`, `TBD-*` IDs; `observed/inferred/unknown`
classification; sensitivity tagging; SME review gate.

**Anti-pattern**: running a full source-first excavation when a RAG-backed
module package is already sufficient. Use Layer 1 to answer specific evidence,
impact, or contradiction questions.

---

## 3. Layer 2 — Synthesis

**Purpose**: Take approved module context and evidence outputs, then synthesize
business-facing artifacts. Layer 2 is platform-agnostic — adding a new legacy
platform (e.g., COBOL/JCL) means adding or swapping the verification family,
while BRD/spec/handoff synthesis stays reusable.

| Skill | Reads | Writes | When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`legacy-brd-writer`](../skills/legacy-brd-writer/SKILL.md) | approved module-analysis | `05_brds/<CAPABILITY-SLUG>/brd.md`, `brd-review.md`, `validation-scenarios.md`, `traceability.md` | After module-analyzer is approved |
| [`legacy-spec-writer`](../skills/legacy-spec-writer/SKILL.md) | approved BRD + module-analysis | `spec.yaml`, `spec.md` | After BRD is SME-approved |
| [`legacy-modernization-decision-writer`](../skills/legacy-modernization-decision-writer/SKILL.md) | spec.yaml entries needing expansion | `05_decisions/<CAPABILITY-SLUG>/` | Optional — when a `DEC-*` becomes large or architecture-governed |

**Sequence**:

```
module-analyzer (approved)
  └─ brd-writer
       └─ SME review (use sme-review-facilitator)
            └─ spec-writer
                 └─ decision-writer (optional, per cross-cutting DEC)
```

**Shared vocabulary**: `BR-*`, `BEH-*`, `DEC-*`, `AC-*`; `needs_sme_review`
status; `observed_behavior` vs `inferred_business_rule` vs
`modernization_decision` separation.

**Anti-pattern**: writing `BR-*` rules in inventory/program-analysis output —
those are extraction artifacts, not synthesis. `BR-*` IDs are minted by
`brd-writer`.

---

## 4. Bridge / Handoff

**Purpose**: Move from this repo's reverse pipeline to the forward Atlas
delivery chain. Validates approval gates and packages structured handoff
inputs.

| Skill | Reads | Writes | Sends To |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`legacy-traceability-packager`](../skills/legacy-traceability-packager/SKILL.md) | spec.yaml + BRD + module + tests | `06_traceability_packages/` | Audit / review |
| [`legacy-brd-to-sdd-handoff`](../skills/legacy-brd-to-sdd-handoff/SKILL.md) | approved spec + traceability package | `06_sdd_handoffs/<CAPABILITY-SLUG>/` (5-file bundle) | Atlas SDD chain |

**Sequence**:

```
spec-writer (approved)
  └─ traceability-packager
       └─ brd-to-sdd-handoff
            → Atlas Engineering Delivery Hub (external)
```

**Anti-pattern**: handing off a spec without traceability or without a named
SME sign-off — Atlas downstream skills will not consume it.

---

## 5. Governance

**Purpose**: Cross-cutting quality and process skills. Called by other skills
or by reviewers, not by end users directly.

| Skill | Role | Used By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`legacy-step-contract`](../skills/legacy-step-contract/SKILL.md) | Defines the INPUT → EXECUTION → OUTPUT → VALIDATION shape every step must follow | Skill authors; reviewers |
| [`legacy-step-validator`](../skills/legacy-step-validator/SKILL.md) | Applies the contract to a completed step package; emits `pass` / `pass_with_warnings` / `blocked` report | Orchestrator before advancing |
| [`legacy-sme-review-facilitator`](../skills/legacy-sme-review-facilitator/SKILL.md) | Runs chat-driven SME review, records decision logs, writes BRD review decisions back to the package, captures sign-off, routes follow-up findings | Between BRD/spec writing and approval |
| [`legacy-runtime-matrix-tester`](../skills/legacy-runtime-matrix-tester/SKILL.md) | Orchestrates runtime smoke evidence + matrix + scorecard decisions across Codex / Claude Code / OpenCode | When new skill is added or version-bumped |
| [`legacy-html-exporter`](../skills/legacy-html-exporter/SKILL.md) | Exports stakeholder-facing Markdown artifacts into standalone HTML companions for easier SME / user review | After BRD/spec/review/status docs already exist and need browser-friendly packaging |

**Pairings (use together, but kept separate intentionally)**:

- `step-contract` ↔ `step-validator`: contract-time vs validation-time. The
  validator imports the contract definition. They share `06_quality/`
  output paths and `BLOCKING / WARNING / OK` finding taxonomy.
- `sme-review-facilitator` is upstream of any Layer 2 / Bridge skill that
  requires `sme_sign_offs[]`. It is not part of the synthesis itself; it
  runs the chat review loop and records SME decisions back into durable
  artifacts.
- `runtime-matrix-tester` is independent of the BRD/spec pipeline but
  required for skill release readiness.
- `html-exporter` is independent of the evidence/spec gate chain. It improves
  review ergonomics only and must not be treated as a source-of-truth writer.

**Why these aren't merged**: see "Why we kept them as separate skills"
section below.

---

## 6. Verification

**Purpose**: Generate old-vs-new comparison evidence so cutover risk is
explicit before parallel-run.

| Skill | Reads | Writes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`legacy-golden-master-test-planner`](../skills/legacy-golden-master-test-planner/SKILL.md) | approved spec + BRD + observed behavior evidence | `06_quality/<CAPABILITY-SLUG>/` (5-file plan with `TC-*`) |

**When**: after `spec-writer` is approved, before Atlas builds the new
implementation. The test plan becomes the equivalence-test contract.

**Planned future skills** (not yet implemented, see README skill roadmap):

- `legacy-equivalence-test-generator` — generate executable tests from the
  test plan

## End-to-End Sequence

### Route A — Module-First Enterprise Path

Use this path when the team has an external RAG bundle, four reviewed flows, or
enough module context to start at the module level:

```
1.  orchestrator                   → "stage: module context; next: module-context-intake"
2.  module-context-intake           → 00_context_packages/<MODULE-SLUG>/
3.  module-analyzer                 → 04_modules/<MODULE-SLUG>/
4.  brd-writer                      → 05_brds/<CAPABILITY-SLUG>/ (BRD + VAL-* scenario seeds)
5.  sme-review-facilitator          → chat review + 07_sme_reviews/<CAPABILITY-SLUG>/ + review-decision.yaml
6.  spec-writer                     → 05_specs/<CAPABILITY-SLUG>/
7.  traceability-packager           → 06_traceability_packages/
8.  brd-to-sdd-handoff              → 06_sdd_handoffs/<CAPABILITY-SLUG>/
                                      → Atlas (external)
```

### Route B — Source-First Discovery / Verification Path

Use this path when the module context is not known yet, or when Route A finds a
gap, contradiction, high-risk rule, or missing source/dictionary/runtime
evidence:

```
1.  orchestrator                   → "stage: scope/evidence; next: evidence-intake"
2.  evidence-intake (gate)         → evidence/manifest.yaml approved
3.  inventory                      → 01_inventory/ approved by SME
4.  program-analyzer × targeted N   → program-analysis-*.md for selected OBJ-*
5.  flow-analyzer × targeted M      → flow-*.md for selected FLOW-*
6.  data-model-analyzer × targeted K → 03_data_models/ for selected data subjects
7.  screen-report-analyzer × targeted J → screen-report-analysis-*.md
8.  runtime-evidence-miner          → 07_runtime-evidence/runtime-evidence.jsonl where logs/spool exist
9.  return to Route A               → update context package / module / BRD
```

Do not run Route B as a full exhaustive prerequisite when Route A already has
enough evidence to proceed. It exists to discover, repair, and verify.

Governance skills (`step-contract`, `step-validator`, `runtime-matrix-tester`,
and `legacy-html-exporter`) are called as needed by the orchestrator, skill
authors, or human reviewers, not in this linear sequence.

## Why We Kept Some Skills Separate (Not Merged)

These four pairs looked like merge candidates but were intentionally kept
separate. Recording the reasons here so future "let's reduce skill count"
proposals can revisit with full context.

### `step-contract` + `step-validator` — kept separate

- Different triggers: contract = author-time (designing a new step).
  Validator = run-time (reviewing a completed step).
- Different outputs: contract block vs validation report.
- Different callers: skill author vs orchestrator.
- Merging produces an 800+ line SKILL.md that violates progressive disclosure
  and forces the LLM to choose a mode every call.
- Both are already field-pilot ready; merging would force re-running smoke
  tests and rewriting scorecards for net-zero functional gain.

### `data-model-analyzer` + `screen-report-analyzer` — kept separate

- Different surfaces: data structure (PF/LF) vs UI/report (DSPF/PRTF).
- Different IBM i sub-skills: SQL/access-path reasoning vs subfile/F-key
  reasoning.
- Mixing both contexts in one prompt makes the LLM choose a surface every
  call and reduces output specificity.

### `brd-writer` + `brd-to-sdd-handoff` — kept separate

- An SME approval gate sits between them. Merging implies a continuous
  flow and risks the LLM skipping SME review.
- BRD is the business artifact; handoff is the contract bundle. Different
  consumers (SME vs Atlas).

### `spec-writer` + `decision-writer` + `traceability-packager` — kept separate

- Decision-writer is **optional** (only for cross-cutting `DEC-*`).
  Merging into spec-writer makes every spec call think it must produce a
  decision package.
- Traceability-packager's real client is audit/review, not spec writing.
  Bundling them gives wrong dependency.
- spec-writer is currently `repo-ready` (9.24); the other two are
  `field-pilot ready` (9.56 / 9.51). Merging would drag the bundle to
  spec-writer's maturity.

## Verification

`scripts/verify-skill-claims.py` checks that every skill listed in
[`skill-status-truth-table.md`](skill-status-truth-table.md) appears in this
document under exactly one family.

Run:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify-skill-claims.py
```
