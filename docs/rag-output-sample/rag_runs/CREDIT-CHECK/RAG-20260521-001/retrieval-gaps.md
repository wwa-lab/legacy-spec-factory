# Retrieval Gaps

RAG must expose missing context explicitly. These gaps should become
`open-questions.md` entries in the Legacy Spec Factory context package.

| Gap ID | Severity | Summary | Evidence | Suggested owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `RAG-GAP-CREDIT-CHECK-001` | medium | `CREDITVW.AVAIL_CREDIT` derivation is not proven by the supplied DDS. | `DDS-CREDIT-CHECK-CUSTMAST-001`, `DDS-CREDIT-CHECK-CREDITVW-001` | IT SME / data owner |
| `RAG-GAP-CREDIT-CHECK-002` | medium | Only one runtime sample is present, so runtime evidence cannot establish normal operating frequency or all edge cases. | `RUN-CREDIT-CHECK-JOBLOG-001`, `RUN-CREDIT-CHECK-SPOOL-001` | QA / operations SME |
| `RAG-GAP-CREDIT-CHECK-003` | low | No real ARCAD REF export is included in the synthetic fixture, so caller/callee completeness is not independently cross-checked. | `SNP-CREDIT-CHECK-001` | IT SME |
| `RAG-GAP-CREDIT-CHECK-004` | medium | No evidence shows whether denied over-limit requests are queued, audited, or simply rejected inline. | `SME-CREDIT-CHECK-001` | Credit Operations SME |
| `RAG-GAP-CREDIT-CHECK-005` | medium | `CREDITCHK` returns a decision from the RPG interface, but the supplied CL wrapper does not visibly capture that return value. | `SNP-CREDIT-CHECK-001`, `SNP-CREDIT-CHECK-004` | IBM i developer / IT SME |

## Non-Blocking Assumptions

| Assumption ID | Statement | Why it is non-blocking for the sample |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RAG-ASM-CREDIT-CHECK-001` | `CRDTCMD` is operational glue, not the business rule owner. | SME note directly says the wrapper is operational glue only. |
| `RAG-ASM-CREDIT-CHECK-002` | `CREDITCHK` is the first downstream target for program analysis. | It contains the field lookup, branch conditions, decision value, and amount output logic. |

## Recommended Next Prompt

```text
Use legacy-ibmi-module-analyzer with the CREDIT-CHECK RAG output package.
Treat source snippets and runtime observations as evidence context only.
Create or update the four module flows, preserve retrieval gaps as open
questions, and do not promote candidate business rules without SME review.
```
