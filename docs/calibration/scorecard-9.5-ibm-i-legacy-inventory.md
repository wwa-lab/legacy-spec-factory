# Calibration Scorecard: 9.5 Field-Pilot Ready

> **Hypothetical snapshot.** This document calibrates what a 9.5 score would

Final score: **9.5 / 10**

## Why This Is 9.5

- Clear trigger and non-goals.
- Explicit output contract and templates.
- SME review is built into the workflow.
- Evidence, sensitivity, and TBD handling are mandatory.
- Runtime portability is addressed with canonical source plus sync script.
- The skill stays focused on inventory and does not collapse into rule mining
  or spec writing.

## Remaining Risk

This score assumes the skill is tested in all three runtimes after sync. If no
runtime validation has happened, cap at 9.0.

## Category Calibration

| Category | What Makes This 9.5 |
| --- | --- |
| Purpose and trigger clarity | The skill says exactly when to use it and explicitly excludes rule mining and Java generation. |
| Workflow completeness | The workflow moves from scope to evidence classification, object inventory, relationships, gaps, SME review, and gate decision. |
| IBM i / domain correctness | It covers programs, CL flow, PF/LF, DSPF, PRTF, spool, data areas, data queues, message queues, copybooks, and jobs. |
| Evidence and anti-hallucination | Missing artifacts become TBDs; object names and calls cannot be invented. |
| Output contract | `inventory.yaml`, `object-map.md`, and review checklist are defined with templates and examples. |
| Progressive disclosure | Core procedure stays in `SKILL.md`; detailed structure lives in references/templates/examples. |
| Runtime portability | Canonical source syncs cleanly to Codex, Claude Code, and OpenCode adapters and has a recorded runtime matrix. |
| Reviewability and testability | Positive and negative examples show expected gate behavior. |
| Engineering handoff value | Output is specific enough for the next analyzer to consume without re-discovering scope. |
| Maintainability | Authorship, version history, ID conventions, and sync rules are explicit. |
