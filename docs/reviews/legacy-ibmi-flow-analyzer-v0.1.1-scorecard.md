## Review Evidence

- Reviewed against `docs/skill-review-gate.md` v0.1.1 revision criteria.
- Checked canonical source under `skills/legacy-ibmi-flow-analyzer/`.
- All 5 blocking issues from v0.1.0 scorecard (FLOW-REV-001 to FLOW-REV-005) have been addressed:

### FLOW-REV-001: Runtime Smoke Tests
- ✅ Added positive prompt (Scheduler + Batch flow) to `docs/runtime-smoke-tests.md`
- ✅ Added negative prompt (missing program-analysis) to `docs/runtime-smoke-tests.md`
- ✅ Pass criteria defined for both scenarios
- ✅ Reference commands provided for all three runtimes
- **Status:** Awaiting execution in Codex CLI, Claude Code, and OpenCode

### FLOW-REV-002: Scheduler→Batch Trigger Model Clarity
- ✅ Updated `SKILL.md` workflow step 1 with explicit note: "Scheduler-submitted batch jobs form a single flow... this is one trigger model, not two"
- ✅ Updated `references/trigger-models.md` section 6 to clarify "one primary trigger (scheduler entry), SBMJOB is submission mechanism, not a separate trigger"
- ✅ Rephrased `examples/batch-job-positive/flow.md` Trigger Model from "Scheduler → Batch Job (combined)" to "Scheduler (submitted via SBMJOB)"
- ✅ Updated `templates/flow.md` with guidance note
- **Status:** Resolved

### FLOW-REV-003: Blocked Status Values
- ✅ Added blocked status options to `output-contract.md` Metadata section: `blocked_pending_source` and `blocked_pending_sme`
- ✅ Documented when each blocked status applies
- ✅ Updated `SKILL.md` workflow step 9 with routing rules for blocked flows
- ✅ Updated `templates/flow.md` Status field with all valid values
- **Status:** Resolved

### FLOW-REV-004: Seed ID Standardization
- ✅ Updated `SKILL.md` step 8 from "Extract `BR-*` candidates" to "Extract `SEED-*` candidates"
- ✅ Added clarifying note: flow analysis does not mint `BR-*`; branch points use `NODE-*` / `EDGE-*`, and capability seeds use `SEED-*`
- ✅ Verified `examples/batch-job-positive/flow.md` uses SEED-NIGHTLY-RECON-* correctly
- **Status:** Resolved

### FLOW-REV-005: Evidence Taxonomy
- ✅ Added comprehensive "Evidence Taxonomy" section to `output-contract.md`
- ✅ Defined 4 evidence types:
  - Type 1: Source statement (CALL, CALLP, SBMJOB in code)
  - Type 2: IBM i object/config export (WRKJOBSCDE, DSPF DDS, trigger config)
  - Type 3: Integration contract (MQ, API gateway, DDM, FTP/IFS)
  - Type 4: SME confirmation (documented procedures, business agreement)
- ✅ Updated `SKILL.md` anti-hallucination rules to allow all 4 evidence types, not just source code
- ✅ Updated `references/trigger-models.md` sections 5, 6, 7 to specify evidence requirements per trigger model
- **Status:** Resolved

## Adapter Sync Verification

- ✅ All five skill files synced via `scripts/sync-skills.sh --target all`
- ✅ Adapter drift check (--check flag) returns OK for all runtimes:
  - `.claude/skills/legacy-ibmi-flow-analyzer`
  - `.opencode/skills/legacy-ibmi-flow-analyzer`
  - `.agents/skills/legacy-ibmi-flow-analyzer`
  - `.codex/skills/legacy-ibmi-flow-analyzer`

## Scoring

v0.1.0 baseline: **9.44 / 10** (capped at 9.0 due to missing runtime smoke tests)

### Changes in v0.1.1

| Category | v0.1.0 | v0.1.1 | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose and trigger clarity | 9.6 | 9.8 | +0.2 (Scheduler→SBMJOB clarification) |
| Workflow completeness | 9.5 | 9.7 | +0.2 (blocked status routing rules added) |
| IBM i / domain correctness | 9.4 | 9.5 | +0.1 (evidence taxonomy added) |
| Evidence and anti-hallucination | 9.6 | 9.7 | +0.1 (4-type evidence taxonomy) |
| Output contract | 9.3 | 9.5 | +0.2 (blocked status values + evidence taxonomy) |
| Progressive disclosure | 9.6 | 9.6 | — |
| Runtime portability | 9.0 | 9.6 (Claude Code passed, Codex/OpenCode pending) | Claude Code smoke test passed 2026-05-14 (haiku) |
| Reviewability and testability | 9.4 | 9.6 | +0.2 (smoke test prompts + pass criteria) |
| Engineering handoff value | 9.6 | 9.7 | +0.1 (evidence taxonomy for downstream) |
| Maintainability | 9.4 | 9.5 | +0.1 (version history + evidence clarity) |

**Expected score before cap:** **9.61 / 10**

**Expected score after smoke test pass:** **9.6 / 10** (no cap; runtime portability lifted from 9.0 to 9.6 upon passed smoke tests)

**Provisional decision:** `field-pilot ready conditional on all three runtimes passing`

**Status Update (2026-05-14):**
- ✅ Claude Code (haiku): Positive scenario PASSED — all 9 sections, trigger model identified, no invented behavior
- ✅ Claude Code (haiku): Negative scenario PASSED — status = blocked_pending_source, correctly routes to program-analyzer
- ⏳ Codex CLI (gpt-5.4-mini): Execution pending
- ⏳ OpenCode (minimax-m2.5-free): Execution pending

## Next Steps: Remaining Smoke Test Execution

To finalize this scorecard at 9.6, run the smoke test protocol in the two remaining runtimes:

### Codex CLI

```bash
codex exec -C . -s read-only --ephemeral -m gpt-5.4-mini \
  "Use /legacy-ibmi-flow-analyzer. User input: I have a scheduler entry NIGHTLY-RECON that fires daily at 22:00 and submits a batch job. The batch calls four RPG programs in sequence: RECONCL (CL entry, orchestrator), RECON01R (validates transactions), RECON02R (builds exception report), RECONSQL (final cross-check with GL ledger via SQL). All four program analyses are approved. Help me analyze the complete flow, including data exchanges, error propagation, and commit boundaries. Return the flow analysis with all 9 sections populated."
```

Expected result: `passed` (all 9 sections, trigger model identified, no invented behavior)

### Claude Code (Read-only tools)

```bash
claude -p --model haiku --permission-mode dontAsk --tools Read --max-budget-usd 0.20 \
  "Use /legacy-ibmi-flow-analyzer. User input: I have a scheduler entry NIGHTLY-RECON that fires daily at 22:00 and submits a batch job. The batch calls four RPG programs in sequence: RECONCL (CL entry, orchestrator), RECON01R (validates transactions), RECON02R (builds exception report), RECONSQL (final cross-check with GL ledger via SQL). All four program analyses are approved. Help me analyze the complete flow, including data exchanges, error propagation, and commit boundaries. Return the flow analysis with all 9 sections populated."
```

Expected result: `passed` (all 9 sections, trigger model identified, no invented behavior)

### OpenCode

```bash
opencode run -m opencode/minimax-m2.5-free \
  "Use /legacy-ibmi-flow-analyzer. User input: I have a scheduler entry NIGHTLY-RECON that fires daily at 22:00 and submits a batch job. The batch calls four RPG programs in sequence: RECONCL (CL entry, orchestrator), RECON01R (validates transactions), RECON02R (builds exception report), RECONSQL (final cross-check with GL ledger via SQL). All four program analyses are approved. Help me analyze the complete flow, including data exchanges, error propagation, and commit boundaries. Return the flow analysis with all 9 sections populated."
```

Expected result: `passed` (all 9 sections, trigger model identified, no invented behavior)

### Negative Scenario (Optional but Recommended)

For each runtime, also run the negative scenario (missing program-analysis):

```text
User input:
I have a flow definition for WEB-ORDER. The entry point is an MQ queue
WEBORDER.IN. The flow calls WEBORDIN → ORDVAL → ORDPRICE → ORDPERSIST → WEBORDOUT.
Program analyses exist for WEBORDIN, ORDVAL, and ORDPERSIST, but ORDPRICE and
WEBORDOUT have no program-analysis yet. What should I do?
```

Expected result: `passed` (status = blocked_pending_source, routes to program-analyzer, does not invent missing programs)

## Final Decision

Once smoke tests are passed in all three runtimes, update this scorecard:
1. Change `decision` to `field-pilot ready`
2. Update `Runtime portability` score to 9.6 and note `passed` status for all three runtimes
3. Change `Provisional decision` to `Final decision: field-pilot ready`
4. Update `docs/runtime-matrix.md` with test dates and model versions used
