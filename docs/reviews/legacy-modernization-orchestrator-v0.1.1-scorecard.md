## Review Evidence

- Reviewed against `docs/skill-review-gate.md`.
- Checked canonical source under `skills/legacy-modernization-orchestrator/`.
- Checked adapter copies under `.claude/`, `.opencode/`, `.agents/`, and
  `.codex/`.
- Ran `scripts/sync-skills.sh --target all`, then
  `scripts/sync-skills.sh --target all --check`; all runtime copies reported
  `OK`.
- Removed canonical-depth-dependent cross-repository links from the
  orchestrator references before scoring v0.1.1.
- Added a planned-skill manual-fallback routing example for Inventory Done to
  program analysis.
- Added `docs/runtime-smoke-tests.md` so future runtime execution checks are
  repeatable.
- Codex CLI smoke test passed with `gpt-5.4-mini`; output matched Stage 1,
  `legacy-ibmi-inventory`, and Redaction Gate pass criteria.
- Claude Code smoke test passed with `haiku` after allowing the `Read` tool so
  the runtime could load the skill files without write access.
- OpenCode smoke test passed with `opencode/minimax-m2.5-free`.

## Mandatory Stop Conditions

No 8.0 cap conditions found.

No 9.0 cap conditions remain after runtime smoke testing:

- portability has been structurally checked, drift-tested, and smoke-tested in
  Codex CLI, Claude Code, and OpenCode
- examples and manual fallbacks are specific enough for repo use

Pilot condition:

- the manual-fallback chain has not been exercised end-to-end through a
  representative capability into Layer 2 artifacts; capture that calibration
  record during the first internal pilot before expanding usage

## Weighted Score

| Category | Weight | Score | Weighted |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Purpose and trigger clarity | 10% | 9.6 | 0.96 |
| Workflow completeness | 12% | 9.5 | 1.14 |
| IBM i / domain correctness | 14% | 9.3 | 1.30 |
| Evidence and anti-hallucination | 12% | 9.6 | 1.15 |
| Output contract | 10% | 9.5 | 0.95 |
| Progressive disclosure | 8% | 9.6 | 0.77 |
| Runtime portability | 10% | 9.6 | 0.96 |
| Reviewability and testability | 10% | 9.5 | 0.95 |
| Engineering handoff value | 8% | 9.4 | 0.75 |
| Maintainability | 6% | 9.5 | 0.57 |

Final score: **9.50 / 10**

Decision: **field-pilot ready with one required pilot calibration record**

## Findings

### Blocking Findings

| ID | Severity | Finding | Required Change | Affects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None | - | No blocking findings remain for field-pilot entry. | - | - |

### Pilot Conditions

| ID | Condition | Required Follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ORCH-PILOT-001 | The orchestrator's planned-skill routing is well specified, but the full manual-fallback chain has not been exercised through a representative capability into Layer 2 artifacts. | During the first internal pilot, walk one redacted IBM i capability from Evidence Ready through inventory, manual fallbacks, `spec.yaml`/`spec.md`, review, and forward handoff gate; capture the results as a calibration record before expanding pilot usage. |

### Improvement Findings

No non-blocking improvement findings remain after the v0.1.1 hardening pass.

## SME Review

- [x] SME governance is explicit
- [x] Observed behavior, inferred rule, and modernization decision are separate
- [x] Evidence tags are required
- [x] IBM i-specific failure modes are covered
- [x] Open questions / TBDs are carried forward instead of hidden

Notes:

The orchestrator keeps IBM i SMEs as the approval authority and blocks unsafe
downstream movement on redaction, inventory coverage, evidence approval, and
forward handoff gates. The skill is especially strong on refusing stage skips
that would turn missing artifacts into invented business rules.

## Runtime Portability Review

- [x] canonical source under `skills/<skill-name>/`
- [x] Claude Code adapter or copy defined if needed
- [x] OpenCode adapter or copy defined if needed
- [x] Codex adapter or copy defined if needed
- [x] runtime-specific metadata isolated from canonical skill

Notes:

The v0.1.1 pass fixed cross-repository links that were correct from the
canonical skill directory but fragile after syncing into runtime adapter
folders. Adapter drift check now passes. Codex CLI, Claude Code, and OpenCode
all passed the routing smoke test.

## Adversarial Pass

| Scenario | Expected Behavior | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Raw evidence with unknown sensitivity | Stop at Redaction Gate | Covered |
| Inventory with blocking coverage gaps | Stop at Inventory Completeness Gate and list TBD IDs | Covered |
| User asks to skip from draft spec to forward SDLC | Refuse skip; require review, approval, and Forward Handoff Gate | Covered |
| Planned downstream skill selected | State `Planned` clearly and provide manual fallback | Covered |
| Mixed-stage artifacts with incomplete upstream coverage | Classify current stage as earliest unmet stage | Covered |

## Requested Revision Prompt For Claude Code

```text
Revise legacy-modernization-orchestrator after the first internal pilot
calibration pass.

Current score: 9.50/10.

Remaining issue:
1. Planned-skill manual fallback routing has not been exercised through a
   representative capability into Layer 2 artifacts.

Required changes:
- Capture one end-to-end manual fallback walk from Evidence Ready to draft
  spec package once the representative artifacts are available, and save it as
  a calibration record.

Do not remove author/copyright notices.
Keep the canonical skill under skills/legacy-modernization-orchestrator/.
Maintain compatibility with Codex, Claude Code, and OpenCode.
