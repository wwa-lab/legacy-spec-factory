# Skill Review Scorecard: legacy-modernization-orchestrator v0.1.0

## Metadata

- skill_path: skills/legacy-modernization-orchestrator
- reviewed_version: v0.1.0
- generated_by: Claude Code
- reviewed_by: self (pending Codex review)
- review_date: 2026-05-13
- target_runtime:
  - [x] Codex
  - [x] Claude Code
  - [x] OpenCode
- decision:
  - [ ] reject
  - [ ] revise
  - [x] repo-ready
  - [ ] field-pilot ready

## Mandatory Stop Conditions

No mandatory 8.0 cap conditions found.

9.0 cap applies because:

- runtime copies have been synced but loading/execution has not yet been
  verified in all target runtimes
- 10 of the 11 referenced downstream skills are `Planned` — the orchestrator
  has been designed for that case (manual-fallback reference) but the routing
  for not-yet-implemented skills cannot be end-to-end validated until at
  least one Layer 2 skill exists

## Weighted Score (self-assessed, awaiting Codex review)

| Category | Weight | Score | Weighted |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Purpose and trigger clarity | 10% | 9.4 | 0.94 |
| Workflow completeness | 12% | 9.2 | 1.10 |
| IBM i / domain correctness | 14% | 9.0 | 1.26 |
| Evidence and anti-hallucination | 12% | 9.4 | 1.13 |
| Output contract | 10% | 9.3 | 0.93 |
| Progressive disclosure | 8% | 9.4 | 0.75 |
| Runtime portability | 10% | 9.0 | 0.90 |
| Reviewability and testability | 10% | 9.2 | 0.92 |
| Engineering handoff value | 8% | 9.3 | 0.74 |
| Maintainability | 6% | 9.3 | 0.56 |

Final score before cap: **9.23 / 10**

Final score after cap: **9.0 / 10**

## Decision

Repo-ready, not field-pilot ready.

## Blocking For 9.5

| ID | Finding | Required Change | Affects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ORCH-REV-001 | Runtime copies synced but not loaded/executed in Codex, Claude Code, and OpenCode | Verify loading/execution in target runtimes; update `docs/runtime-matrix.md` | Runtime portability |
| ORCH-REV-002 | Manual-fallback paths for 10 planned skills are described but never end-to-end exercised | When the first Layer 2 skill (`legacy-spec-writer`) ships, walk one capability through the orchestrator → manual fallbacks → spec-writer chain and capture findings | Workflow completeness |
| ORCH-REV-003 | Codex independent review not yet performed | Submit to Codex review against `docs/skill-review-gate.md` | Reviewability |

## Strengths

- Clear router-only role; explicit non-goals (does not replace any
  downstream skill)
- Four hard gates with non-bypassable rules and specific block-action lists
- Stage identification table maps user-visible artifacts to canonical
  stages, including disambiguation rules for mixed-stage inputs
- Manual-fallback document keeps the orchestrator useful even with 1 of 11
  downstream skills implemented
- Output structure follows a fixed template (Workflow Decision / Routing
  Notes / Next Step), matching the forward orchestrator's discipline
- Cross-chain handoff to `wwa-lab/build-agent-skill` is explicit and gated
- SME reminders surface at every approval transition

## Requested Revision Prompt For Claude Code

```text
Once `legacy-spec-writer` is implemented, exercise this orchestrator
end-to-end on one capability and update v0.2.0 with:
- a real worked example using the spec-writer route (replacing one manual
  fallback example)
- runtime-matrix updated to `executed` or `passed` for all three runtimes
- any decision-table corrections found in real use
```
