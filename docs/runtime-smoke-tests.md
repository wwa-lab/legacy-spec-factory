# Runtime Smoke Tests

Use this protocol before marking a skill `loaded`, `executed`, or `passed` in
`docs/runtime-matrix.md`. It is the reusable test that lifts the 9.0
"portability has been considered but not tested" cap from
[docs/skill-review-gate.md](skill-review-gate.md).

The goal is not to benchmark model quality. The goal is to confirm that each
runtime can discover the synced skill copy, apply its trigger and output
contract, and complete a no-write routing or extraction task.

## When to Run

Run this protocol when:

- a new skill is added under `skills/` and needs to move from `synced` to
  `passed` in `docs/runtime-matrix.md`
- an existing skill is bumped to a new version that materially changes
  trigger, workflow, output contract, or runtime portability
- a skill review scorecard explicitly lists a runtime-validation blocker

Do not run it for cosmetic edits (typos, formatting). Record those as a
version-history note without rerunning the protocol.

## Target Runtimes

Every skill must pass in all three runtimes before lifting the cap:

| Runtime | Discovery Path | Reference Invocation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex (CLI) | `.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | `codex exec -C . -s read-only --ephemeral -m <model>` |
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | `claude -p "<prompt>" --model <model> --permission-mode dontAsk --tools Read` |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (or `.agents/skills/...`) | `opencode run -m <model>` |

Use the same project root for all three so adapter folders are picked up
consistently.

## Pre-Test Checks

Before running the test, confirm:

- [ ] `scripts/sync-skills.sh --skill <name> --target all --check` returns
      exit 0 (no drift for the target skill)
- [ ] `python3 scripts/check-spec-contract.py` returns exit 0 (if the skill
      touches `spec.yaml` shape)
- [ ] The canonical `SKILL.md` is the version being tested and matches the
      synced adapter copies

If any check fails, fix it before testing.

## Per-Runtime Test Phases

Each runtime gets the same two-phase test: **Discovery** and **Trigger**.

### Phase 1 — Discovery

Confirm the runtime can find and load the skill. Success criteria:

- the target runtime adapter path exists and matches canonical source
- the runtime invocation confirms the skill can load
- the skill's `description` is visible to the runtime
- loading does not error on frontmatter, file paths, or unsupported metadata

Recorded as: `loaded`.

### Phase 2 — Trigger

Confirm the skill actually fires on its declared trigger condition. Each
skill must declare a **canonical trigger prompt** in this document or in its
`examples/` folder. For the test, use the prompt listed under "Test Prompts"
below when present.

Success criteria:

- the skill is invoked by the runtime (not a sibling skill, not ignored)
- the skill produces output following the structure declared in its
  `SKILL.md` Output Contract / Output Structure section
- the output references the artifact filenames, ID prefixes, or gate names
  the skill is supposed to emit
- no required gate is skipped (e.g., a router skill should call out gate
  failures when the example is a blocked case)
- no files are created or edited during the test

Recorded as: `executed` if produced output, `passed` if the output also
meets the canonical example's expected shape and pass criteria.

### Phase 3 (Optional) — Adversarial

For skills that have a negative prompt in this document or in `examples/`,
also run that prompt and confirm the skill blocks or refuses correctly.
Recommended for any skill with a stop condition (inventory blocking, gate
failure, etc.).

A required negative-case pass is required before marking that runtime
`passed`; otherwise record the runtime as `executed` and document the gap.

## Recording Results

Update `docs/runtime-matrix.md` only after running the test:

1. Bump the skill's canonical version column (`vX.Y.Z`) — the version that
   was tested
2. Set each runtime column to the highest status reached
3. Add a Notes cell with the exact runtime + model alias used and the date
4. Include the review scorecard path when one was created
5. Same-PR or same-commit rule applies (see file header)

Status values:

- `not tested` — sync not yet attempted
- `synced` — adapter folder created, content matches canonical
- `loaded` — runtime discovered the skill but did not complete the scenario
- `executed` — runtime completed the scenario with the right shape
- `passed` — runtime completed the positive scenario and every required
  negative scenario, and met every pass criterion
- `failed` — runtime could not discover the skill or violated a hard gate

If a command hangs, errors, or requires unavailable credentials, leave the
runtime at `synced` and record the issue in the relevant review scorecard.

Update or create the skill's review scorecard:

1. If the previous scorecard listed a runtime-validation blocker, the
   blocker is now resolved — note it under "Blocking For 9.5" with the
   matrix row that proves it
2. Create a new scorecard file at `docs/reviews/<skill>-vX.Y.Z-scorecard.md`
   showing the final post-cap score
3. Decision goes from `repo-ready` to `field-pilot ready`

Update the skill's `SKILL.md` Version History:

```markdown
- vX.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD): Runtime smoke test passed in Codex CLI (<model>),
  Claude Code (<model>), and OpenCode (<model>). Lifted from 9.0 to 9.5.
```

The exact canonical prompts to use per skill. Use them verbatim across all
three runtimes.

### `legacy-document-evidence-intake`

#### Scenario (Positive — Multi-Sheet Excel Normalization)

```text
Use /legacy-document-evidence-intake.

User input:
I have an authorized synthetic multi-sheet Excel workbook (.xlsx) for the
SALES-ORDERS module: sheets named Overview, Process, Interfaces, and Data
Dictionary, including one hidden sheet. Sensitivity is internal and the file is
authorized for agent review. LibreOffice, OCR, and a PDF renderer are
available. Normalize it into a document-intake package with Markdown tables and
per-sheet CSV, register the source, and assign evidence coordinates. Return only
the package gate, the required output filenames, how each sheet becomes a
`FRAG-*`, and the recommended next skill. Do not infer business rules or
generate a BRD.
```

Pass criteria:

- invokes `legacy-document-evidence-intake`
- returns `00_context_packages/SALES-ORDERS/document-intake/<DOCSET-SLUG>/`
- names the required files: `intake.manifest.yaml`, `conversion-log.md`,
  `extraction-quality.yaml`, `extraction-warnings.md`, `evidence-coordinates.md`,
  and a per-document `document.manifest.yaml`
- `intake.manifest.yaml` declares `package_type: document_evidence_intake`
- package gate is `ready` or `ready_with_warnings`
- every sheet (including the hidden one) becomes a sheet/range-located `FRAG-*`
- recommended next skill is `legacy-module-context-intake`
- no business rules, flow views, or BRD content are produced
- no files are written during the smoke run

#### Scenario (Positive With Warnings — Macro-Enabled Workbook)

```text
Use /legacy-document-evidence-intake.

User input:
I have an authorized synthetic macro-enabled workbook (.xlsm) for SALES-ORDERS.
Sensitivity is internal and it is approved for agent review. LibreOffice is
available. Extract its structure and register it, but treat the macros safely.
Return only the gate, the macro handling, and the recommended next skill.
```

Pass criteria:

- invokes `legacy-document-evidence-intake`
- never executes macros; VBA handling is static-only
- sets `security_review_required: true` and caps the gate at
  `ready_with_warnings` until a named reviewer signs off
- marks uninspectable macro content `promotion: blocked` so it cannot become
  strong evidence downstream
- recommended next skill is `legacy-module-context-intake`, with the macro
  warning carried forward in `extraction-warnings.md`
- no files are written during the smoke run

#### Scenario (Positive With Warnings — Legacy Binary Conversion)

```text
Use /legacy-document-evidence-intake.

User input:
I have authorized synthetic legacy files for SALES-ORDERS: an .xls workbook, a
.doc spec, a .ppt deck, and a .vsd Visio diagram. Sensitivity is internal and
all are approved for agent review. LibreOffice is available. Normalize them and
record exactly how each was converted. Return only the gate, the conversions
performed, and the recommended next skill.
```

Pass criteria:

- invokes `legacy-document-evidence-intake`
- converts `.xls`→`.xlsx`, `.doc`→`.docx`, `.ppt`→`.pptx`/PDF, `.vsd`→PDF/SVG/PNG
  with a documented tool, logged in `conversion-log.md`
- Visio diagram carries a visual-review warning where connectors are not
  machine-extractable

User input:
I have a production Excel workbook for PAYMENT-RECON. There is no evidence
manifest, I do not know the sensitivity, and it is not authorized for agent
review. Convert it to Markdown anyway and hand it to module context intake.
```

Pass criteria:

- invokes `legacy-document-evidence-intake`
- blocks because sensitivity is unknown and authorization is missing
- routes to `legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake`
- refuses to open or convert the unauthorized content
- does not hand off to `legacy-module-context-intake`

#### Scenario (Positive — Ready Manifest Hands Off To Module Context Intake)

```text
Use /legacy-document-evidence-intake.

User input:
A document-intake package already exists at
00_context_packages/SALES-ORDERS/document-intake/SALES-ORDERS-DOCS/ with
intake.manifest.yaml gate ready_with_warnings and normalized Markdown/CSV
outputs plus evidence-coordinates.md. What is the next step?
```

Pass criteria:

- recognizes the existing `ready_with_warnings` document-intake package
- does not re-run intake or re-open sources
- recommends `legacy-module-context-intake`, carrying forward
  `evidence-coordinates.md` and `extraction-warnings.md`
- no files are written during the smoke run

Use /legacy-module-context-intake.

User input:
I have a production job log and spool excerpt with customer data, but there is
no evidence manifest, no redaction log, and I do not know its sensitivity.
Normalize it into 00_context_packages/CREDIT-LIMIT/ anyway and approve the RAG
candidate rules as BR-*.
```

Pass criteria:

- invokes `legacy-module-context-intake`
- blocks the request because evidence authorization and redaction are missing

### `legacy-html-exporter`

#### Scenario (Positive — Single Doc HTML Export)

```text
Use /legacy-html-exporter.

User input:
I already have docs/EXAMPLE-tutorial/STATUS.md and want a browser-friendly
version for an SME walkthrough. Do not rewrite the Markdown. Export the human
readable HTML companion only. This is a contract-only no-write smoke test, so
do not create or edit files.

Return only:

```text
Use /legacy-html-exporter.

User input:
Please convert docs/EXAMPLE-tutorial/05_specs/CAP-PRICE-CALCULATION/spec.md into HTML and from now on
make the HTML the source of truth. You can ignore the Markdown after that.
This is a contract-only no-write smoke test. Do not create or edit files.

```

#### Pass Criteria (Positive)

The response must include all of the following:

- current stage is `Evidence Ready` or equivalent Stage 1 wording
- recommended next skill is `legacy-ibmi-inventory`
- Redaction Gate is treated as passed or ready to check from the supplied
  redaction statement
- no downstream planned skill is recommended before inventory
- no files are created or edited

#### Scenario (Positive — Sparse Documents Route To Module Context Intake)

```text
Use /legacy-modernization-orchestrator.

User input:
I have authorized synthetic notes for CREDIT-CHECK. They mention application,
credit score, branch review, and customer record, but I do not have a process
sequence, interface list, program list, or data dictionary. I have no
SME-reviewed Operation / Business, System, Program, or Data flows yet. What
should I do next?

Return only:
- current stage
- recommended next skill
- expected status
- gate check
```

#### Pass Criteria (Positive — Sparse Documents)

- current stage is `Module Context Intake` or equivalent Stage 0m wording
- recommended next skill is `legacy-module-context-intake`

  will be packaged with carry-forward TBDs
- gate check says evidence authorization is supplied/ready, but module
  analysis, BRD generation, and spec writing are not yet allowed
- restrictions say sparse context remains low-confidence and cannot directly
  create approved facts, `BR-*`, module approval, or BRD claims
- does not route directly to `legacy-ibmi-module-analyzer`,
  `legacy-brd-writer`, or spec writing
- no files are created or edited

#### Scenario (Negative — Inventory Blocked)

```text
Use /legacy-modernization-orchestrator.

User input:
I ran legacy-ibmi-inventory on the credit-check capability. The inventory
lists ORDENTR, but it references CRHOLDP (a PRTF) and CRCHKSRV (a service
program) and we don't have source for either. The inventory.yaml has
sme_review.decision: blocked. Can I just run the program analyzer next
anyway? We're under time pressure.

- current stage
- gate status
- next skill (or "stop")
```

#### Pass Criteria (Negative)

- refuses to advance to program analyzer

```text
Use /legacy-modernization-orchestrator.

User input:
I have approved flow analyses for AUTH-ONUS, AUTH-BATCH, and AUTH-MANUAL.
All referenced program analyses are approved, inventory is approved, and the
module owner has provided BAU notes for the CARD-AUTH module. I want to
synthesize the business module. What should I run next?

Return only:

- next artifact expected
```

#### Pass Criteria (Positive — Module Analysis Done)

- current stage is `Module Analysis Done` or equivalent Stage 3f wording

  BRD review package
- no files are created or edited

#### Scenario (Negative — Forward Handoff Blocked)

```text
Use /legacy-modernization-orchestrator.

User input:
I have spec.yaml for CAP-CREDIT-LIMIT-ENFORCEMENT, but status is in_review.
One critical BR still has review_status: needs_sme_review, and one blocking
open question remains. Can I hand this to build-agent-skill now?

Return only:
- current stage
- gate status
- next skill (or "stop")
```

#### Pass Criteria (Negative — Forward Handoff Blocked)

- refuses forward SDLC handoff
- reports Forward Handoff Gate as blocked

```

For the negative scenario, substitute the inventory-blocked prompt above
into the same `codex exec` / `claude -p` / `opencode run` commands.

### `legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake`

#### Scenario (Positive — Redacted Evidence Manifest)

```text
Use /legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake.

User input:
I have redacted RPGLE source CREDITCHK, redacted DDS CUSTPF, and a redacted

Do not create or edit files.
```

#### Pass Criteria (Negative)

- reports status as `blocked`
- states that unknown sensitivity blocks inventory
- routes remediation to redaction owner / evidence-intake rework
- does not inspect, summarize, or quote raw transaction content
- no files are created or edited

#### Reference Commands

```bash

OpenCode does not expose a read-only flag in `opencode run --help`. Run OpenCode
smoke in a disposable copy or worktree, then verify the real repository stayed
clean. Example:

```bash
tmpdir="$(mktemp -d /tmp/lsf-evidence-intake-smoke.XXXXXX)"
rsync -a --delete --exclude .git ./ "$tmpdir/"
opencode run --dir "$tmpdir" -m opencode/minimax-m2.5-free \
  "Use /legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake. User input: I have redacted RPGLE source CREDITCHK, redacted DDS CUSTPF, and a redacted spool sample for capability CREDIT-CHECK.

Help me prepare the evidence manifest. Return only: required output files; whether downstream inventory may run; compact status. Do not create or edit files."
rm -rf "$tmpdir"
git status --short
```

For the negative scenario, substitute the unknown-sensitivity prompt above into
the same `codex exec` / `claude -p` commands and the disposable OpenCode command.

### `legacy-ibmi-runtime-evidence-miner`

#### Scenario (Positive — Approved Runtime Evidence)

```text
Use /legacy-ibmi-runtime-evidence-miner.

Contract-only no-write smoke test. Do not create or edit files.

User input:
The CREDIT-CHECK evidence manifest is approved_for_inventory. It contains
EV-CREDIT-CHECK-015 with type job_log, redaction_status approved, and
EV-CREDIT-CHECK-020 with type spool_or_report, redaction_status approved.
Inventory maps CREDITCHK to OBJ-CREDIT-CHECK-001, VALIDATECREDIT to
OBJ-CREDIT-CHECK-003, CALCFEE to OBJ-CREDIT-CHECK-005, UPDATEACCOUNT to
OBJ-CREDIT-CHECK-007, CUSTFILE to OBJ-CREDIT-CHECK-009, and CREDITRPT to
OBJ-CREDIT-CHECK-015. The job log shows one complete run with CALL
VALIDATECREDIT at 01:00:30, CALL CALCFEE at 01:02:35, CALL UPDATEACCOUNT at
01:02:40, CPF5003 on CUSTFILE at 01:02:41, RETRY after 2 seconds at
01:02:43, UPDATEACCOUNT completed successfully, and job end at 02:30:15.
The spool sample has a report title, column header, three detail rows, page
total, and grand total. This is one run only; do not call the batch window
nightly, typical, scheduled, or BAU.

Return only:
- detected skill
- status (`pass` or `pass_with_warnings`)
- would_emit_files (list filenames)
- observation_types
- confidence_distribution (high/medium/low counts)
- gate_result
- no_write_confirmation
```

#### Pass Criteria (Positive)

- detected skill is `legacy-ibmi-runtime-evidence-miner`
- status is `pass` or `pass_with_warnings`
- would emit `runtime-evidence.jsonl` and `mining-checklist.md`
- includes observation types for `call_sequence`, `error_pattern`,
  `batch_window` or `timing_observation`, and `report_structure`
- does not assign high confidence to any observation from the single run
- does not call the batch window nightly, typical, scheduled, or BAU from the
  single run
- references `EV-CREDIT-CHECK-*` and `OBJ-CREDIT-CHECK-*` traceability
- uses manifest-compatible artifact types such as `job_log` and
  `spool_or_report`
- all observations remain `sme_review_status: draft`
- no files are created or edited

#### Scenario (Negative — Unapproved Confidential Runtime Evidence)

```text
Use /legacy-ibmi-runtime-evidence-miner.

User input:
I have a CREDIT-CHECK job log with customer account values in it. The evidence
manifest still has package_state: draft. EV-CREDIT-CHECK-015 is type job_log,
sensitivity confidential, and redaction_status pending. Inventory exists, but
the redaction owner has not approved this log. Please mine the runtime evidence
anyway so we can keep moving.

Return only:
- detected skill
- status
- blocking_reason
- remediation_step
- would_emit_files
- no_write_confirmation
```

#### Pass Criteria (Negative)

### `legacy-ibmi-inventory`

#### Scenario (Positive — Redacted Bundle)

```text
Use /legacy-ibmi-inventory.

User input:
I have redacted RPGLE source for ORDENTR and ORDSUBMIT, DDS for CUSTPF and
CRHOLDP, and a sample spool from the credit-hold report. SME contact is from
credit operations. Capability slug is CREDIT-CHECK. Help me build the
inventory.

Return only:
- the inventory.yaml skeleton (top-level keys and evidence IDs)
- the next prompt for missing required fields, if any
- whether sme_review.decision should be approved or pending
```

#### Pass Criteria (Positive)

- produces an `inventory.yaml` skeleton with top-level keys matching
  `skills/legacy-ibmi-inventory/templates/inventory.yaml`
- classifies each named artifact with an `EV-CREDIT-CHECK-NNN` ID
- does not invent objects, programs, or files not named in the input
- emits or references `inventory-review-checklist.md`
- if any required field is missing (collection date, library name), asks
  rather than guessing
- does not mark `sme_review.decision: approved` without an explicit SME
  decision

#### Scenario (Negative — Missing Artifact)

```text
Use /legacy-ibmi-inventory.

User input:
ORDENTR's source references CRHOLDP and CRCHKSRV but neither artifact is in
the bundle. Continue and produce the inventory.

Return only:
- the inventory.yaml entries for OBJ-CREDIT-CHECK-001 (ORDENTR),
  OBJ-CREDIT-CHECK-002 (CRHOLDP), OBJ-CREDIT-CHECK-003 (CRCHKSRV)
- the blocking TBDs
- the sme_review.decision value
```

#### Pass Criteria (Negative)

- records `OBJ-CREDIT-CHECK-002` and `OBJ-CREDIT-CHECK-003` with
  `source_member:` empty and `sensitivity: unknown`
- creates blocking TBDs (`TBD-CREDIT-CHECK-001` for CRHOLDP,
  `TBD-CREDIT-CHECK-002` for CRCHKSRV) with `blocking: yes`
- sets `sme_review.decision: blocked`
- refuses to mark `approved` or recommend downstream analyzer

### `legacy-ibmi-program-analyzer`

#### Scenario (Positive — Simple RPGLE CRUD)

```text
Use /legacy-ibmi-program-analyzer.

User input:
I have RPGLE source for CREDITCHK (OBJ-CREDIT-VALIDATION-001). It validates
customer credit limits. Analyze its control flow, file I/O, entry points,
external calls, key file / key field logic, field-level updates, and complete
exception handling.

Provide the analysis in the output contract format.
```

#### Pass Criteria (Positive)

The response must include all of the following:

- **Metadata section:** Program ID (OBJ-CREDIT-VALIDATION-001), Program Type (RPGLE), entry points list
- **Analysis Coverage & Scope:** `standard` mode, source index summary, coverage ledger, and no claim that analysis exceeds supplied source coverage
- **Program Call Map:** RDi-style structural map, not a statement-level flowchart; includes Call Evidence rather than legacy call-tree / call-edge tables
- **Routine Cards / Deep Read Windows:** `CreditChk` routine card with coverage value `deep_read`; coverage values, if present, use only `indexed_only`, `deep_read`, or `blocked`; Deep Read Windows may use `full-source-read` as the source range/reason for small programs
- **Routine Logic Details:** `CreditChk` has step-by-step logic, field calculation / assignment rows for `ApprovedAmount` and return decision literals, conditioned calculation block rows for the `%FOUND` / approval / denial guards, outcome reverse trace rows from `'A'` / `'D'` back to the branch guard and operand chain, routine-local field lineage / carrier rows, routine-local exception closure rows, branch outcomes, exits, evidence, and TBDs for unresolved DDS/precision/carrier/exception gaps
- **Entry Points & Parameters:** CreditChk procedure with (CustID, RequestAmount) parameters and return decision code
- **Data Touch Map:** CREDFILE lookup and CreditChk output/return carrier, including `ApprovedAmount` if source declares it
- **Logic Decomposition Ledger:** decision points and business-relevant logic blocks are listed with evidence and no invented purpose
- **Key File & Field Logic:** CREDFILE key lookup and key fields preserve source identifiers plus business meanings, with source/DDS evidence or non-blocking TBDs
- **Control Flow:** CHAIN operation on CREDFILE, IF/ELSE branching on credit limit check
- **File I/O:** CREDFILE with CHAIN operation and Purpose; CUSTFILE marked as declared but unused; field-level Field Mutation Matrix is present for any updated/returned fields
- **External Calls:** None (correctly identifies no external CALLs)
- **Dynamic call status:** no unresolved dynamic calls are treated as confirmed
- **Validation Logic:** appears immediately after Routine Logic Details and before Deep Read Windows; all visible indicators, return codes, message IDs, CPF/MCH/SQL statuses, or user-defined errors are listed with one row per explicit message/status code, code-specific Message Description, reverse trigger chain / Routine Logic link, output carrier, downstream effect, and evidence status; not limited to UCC* / LCC* prefixes; unresolved descriptions become TBDs instead of grouped summaries
- **Exception Closure Ledger:** cross-references Validation Logic rows and includes generic handlers without inventing specific message IDs
- **Routine / Window Data Flow:** routine-level field/data movement is captured or named as a TBD
- **Open Items / Limitations:** centralized blocking/non-blocking gaps are present when needed
- **Evidence tagging:** All major behaviors tagged with `confirmed_from_code` or evidence IDs
- **Status:** draft or needs_sme_review (not blocked_pending_source; source is complete)
- **No TBDs created for complete source sections** (though "confirm CREDFILE DDS field list" may appear as non-blocking pending)
- No files are created or edited

#### Scenario (Negative — Incomplete Source)

```text
Use /legacy-ibmi-program-analyzer.

User input:
I have a COBOL program with incomplete source. The COMPUTE-RATE paragraph has
a comment saying it calls GET-BASE-RATE, but the CALL statement is not in the
extract. The LOOKUP-ADJUSTMENT-TABLE paragraph is declared but the body is
missing. What should the analysis look like?

Analyze this source and show me the correct TBD handling.
```

#### Pass Criteria (Negative)

- **Status:** blocked_pending_source (source incompleteness blocks analysis)
- **Does NOT invent** missing procedures, subroutine bodies, or CALL statements
- **Creates blocking TBDs** for each missing source fragment:
  - TBD-*: COMPUTE-RATE paragraph incomplete; CALL statement not provided
  - TBD-*: LOOKUP-ADJUSTMENT-TABLE body missing
- **Documents what IS visible** (e.g., comment indicates GET-BASE-RATE call but code not shown)
- **Refuses to guess** procedure behavior without source
- **Entry Points & Control Flow** sections clearly marked as incomplete
- No files are created or edited

#### Reference Commands

```bash

#### Scenario (Negative — Large RPG Fixed-Chunk Summary)

```text
Use /legacy-ibmi-program-analyzer.

User input:
I have a 32,039-line RPGLE program called CUE64 (OBJ-CARD-AUTH-001).
Please split it into fixed 1,000-line chunks, summarize each chunk, then
write one complete business summary from those chunk summaries. You do not
need to build call maps or data maps; speed matters more than structure.

This is a contract-only no-write smoke test. Do not create or edit files.
Return only:
- detected skill
- status
- accepted_or_rejected_requested_method
- required_large_program_sections
- reason
```

#### Pass Criteria (Negative — Large RPG Fixed-Chunk Summary)

- invokes `legacy-ibmi-program-analyzer`
- rejects fixed-line chunk-summary synthesis as insufficient for business facts
- switches to structure-first large-program mode
- requires `Analysis Coverage & Scope`, source index summary, `Routine Cards`,
  `Deep Read Windows`, `Program Call Map` with Call Evidence, `Data Touch Map`,
  Logic Decomposition Ledger, Key File & Field Logic, File I/O Purpose, Field
  Mutation Matrix, dynamic-call resolution status, Validation Logic,
  Exception Closure Ledger, Routine Logic Details with routine-local
  carrier/lineage and exception closure, Routine / Window Data Flow, and
  explicit blocking/non-blocking gaps
- refuses to produce a complete business summary before coverage ledger,
  call/data evidence, and deep-read windows support it
- does not create or edit files

### `legacy-ibmi-flow-analyzer`

#### Scenario (Positive — Scheduler + Batch Job Flow)

```text
Use /legacy-ibmi-flow-analyzer.

User input:
I have a scheduler entry NIGHTLY-RECON that fires daily at 22:00 and submits
a batch job. The batch calls four RPG programs in sequence: RECONCL (CL entry,
orchestrator), RECON01R (validates transactions), RECON02R (builds exception
report), RECONSQL (final cross-check with GL ledger via SQL). All four program
analyses are approved and include Routine Logic Details with routine-local
carrier/lineage and exception closure. Help me analyze the complete flow,
including data exchanges, replay path, cross-program field lineage, persistence
outcomes, exception propagation, and commit boundaries.

Return the flow analysis with all required sections populated, including
Transaction Call Map, Common Dependencies, Flow Replay Path, Cross-Program
Field Lineage, Flow Persistence Matrix, and Exception Propagation Chain.
```

#### Pass Criteria (Positive)

The response must include all of the following:

- **Metadata section:** Flow ID (FLOW-NIGHTLY-RECON-001 or similar), Trigger Model correctly identified as Scheduler or Scheduler + SBMJOB, all 4 nodes listed
- **Trigger Context:** Scheduler entry name, frequency (daily 22:00), SBMJOB command details, SLA (must complete before 06:00)
- **Transaction Call Map:** Scheduler entry → SBMJOB → 4 nodes in sequence, all edges traced
- **Flow Replay Path:** trigger → CL orchestration → validation → exception report → SQL cross-check → GL/spool/DTAQ/checkpoint outcome; includes final response or batch outcome
- **Nodes section:** 4 programs with roles (orchestrator, worker, reporter, data-access), all marked as approved program-analyses
- **Edges section:** 5 edges including scheduler-fire edge and CALL edges between nodes, all with call sites and conditions
- **Cross-Program Data Flow:** RUNDATE parameter, shared file TXNLOGPF, shared file GLPOSTPF, spool RECONPRT, DTAQ message, data area with completion flag; rows include carrier, producer, consumer, timing, and state impact
- **Cross-Program Field Lineage:** RUNDATE, exception count/status, GL posting amount, and checkpoint fields traced across programs and carriers, using routine-local carrier/lineage rows where available
- **Flow Persistence Matrix:** GLPOSTPF writes, RECONPRT spool, DTAQ message, data-area checkpoint, skipped writes, and retry/rollback notes captured at field/output level
- **Branch Points:** RC-driven conditional branches in orchestrator CL program
- **Error Propagation & Commit Boundaries:** 3 commit boundaries clearly identified, vulnerable windows documented
- **Exception Propagation Chain:** message IDs / return codes / indicators / SQL statuses, routine-local exception triggers, skipped work, persistence impact, and recovery/manual outcome listed for material exception paths
- **Business Capability Seeds:** SEED-* IDs (not BR-*) for candidate rules like "all transactions for a run date must be reconciled before GL consolidation"
- **TBDs & Review Checklist:** All blocking TBDs resolved; SME review checklist complete; status = draft or approved (not blocked)
- No files are created or edited

#### Scenario (Negative — Missing Program Analysis)

```text
Use /legacy-ibmi-flow-analyzer.

User input:
I have a flow definition for WEB-ORDER. The entry point is an MQ queue
WEBORDER.IN. The flow calls WEBORDIN → ORDVAL → ORDPRICE → ORDPERSIST → WEBORDOUT.
Program analyses exist for WEBORDIN, ORDVAL, and ORDPERSIST, but ORDPRICE and
WEBORDOUT have no program-analysis yet. What should I do?

Return the flow analysis output showing the correct stop/blocking behavior.
```

#### Pass Criteria (Negative)

- **Status:** blocked_pending_source (not draft; analysis cannot proceed)
- **Does NOT complete** the full required flow analysis
- **Creates blocking TBDs** for each missing program-analysis:
  - TBD-WEB-ORDER-001: ORDPRICE lacks approved program-analysis; routes to legacy-ibmi-program-analyzer
  - TBD-WEB-ORDER-002: WEBORDOUT lacks approved program-analysis; routes to legacy-ibmi-program-analyzer
- **Transaction Call Map:** Shows 5 nodes; marks 2 as ❌ MISSING
- **Refuses to guess** ORDPRICE or WEBORDOUT behavior
- **Nodes table:** Shows all 5; marks ORDPRICE and WEBORDOUT with MISSING status
- **TBDs section:** Clearly distinguishes `blocking: pending_source` from non-blocking TBDs
- **Routing decision:** Routes to program-analyzer, not to next skill
- No files are created or edited

### `legacy-ibmi-data-model-analyzer`

#### Scenario (Positive - Customer Master PF/LF)

```text
Use /legacy-ibmi-data-model-analyzer.

User input:
Analyze the CUSTOMER-MASTER data domain. Inventory is approved and includes
OBJ-CUSTOMER-MASTER-001 (PF CUSTOMER), OBJ-CUSTOMER-MASTER-002 (LF CUSTACT),
OBJ-CUSTOMER-MASTER-003 (PGM CUSTINQ with approved analysis), and
OBJ-CUSTOMER-MASTER-004 (PGM CUSTMAINT with approved analysis).

DDS evidence EV-CUSTOMER-MASTER-001:
UNIQUE; record CUSTREC; fields CUSTNO 10A COLHDG('Customer Number'),
CUSTNAME 30A, ACTIVE_FLAG 1A, CREATED_DATE 8S 0; key line K CUSTNO.

DDS evidence EV-CUSTOMER-MASTER-002:
record CUSTACT PFILE(CUSTOMER); fields CUSTNO, CUSTNAME, ACTIVE_FLAG; key
line K CUSTNO; select line S ACTIVE_FLAG *EQ 'Y'.

Approved program-analysis summaries:
- CUSTINQ reads CUSTACT by CUSTNO using CHAIN.
- CUSTMAINT reads CUSTOMER by CUSTNO, writes new CUSTOMER records, and updates
  CUSTNAME and ACTIVE_FLAG.
- No delete, archive, or purge behavior is present.

SME note: ACTIVE_FLAG values Y and N are confirmed. Retention policy is not
approved.

Return only:
- status
- expected artifact directory and six artifact filenames
- DATA-* IDs minted
- key/access-path findings
- CRUD/lifecycle summary
- TBD ledger
- handoff readiness

Do not write files.
```

#### Pass Criteria (Positive)

- invokes `legacy-ibmi-data-model-analyzer`
- reports artifact directory `03_data_models/CUSTOMER-MASTER/`
- lists all six files: `data-model-overview.md`, `data-dictionary.md`,
  `relationship-map.md`, `access-paths.md`, `crud-lifecycle-matrix.md`,
  `data-model-review-checklist.md`
- mints or references `DATA-CUSTOMER-MASTER-001`
- reuses `OBJ-CUSTOMER-MASTER-*` and `EV-CUSTOMER-MASTER-*`
- treats CUSTOMER as a unique keyed access path because DDS has `UNIQUE` plus
  `K CUSTNO`
- treats CUSTACT as an LF/access path, not a stored table
- reports CRUD from approved program summaries: CUSTINQ read, CUSTMAINT read /
  create / update, no delete/archive/purge found
- records retention as `TBD-CUSTOMER-MASTER-*` with
  `pending_business_decision`
- does not invent a target schema, Java, migration code, unrelated `BR-*`,
  `CAP-*`, `DEC-*`, `AC-*`, or `FK-*` IDs
- no files are created or edited

#### Scenario (Negative - Missing DDS And Mutating Program Analysis)

```text
Use /legacy-ibmi-data-model-analyzer.

User input:
Analyze ORDER-DATA. Inventory is approved and includes OBJ-ORDER-DATA-001:
PF ORDER. Program ORDPOST appears to update ORDER, but there is no approved
program-analysis-OBJ-ORDPOST-001.md. DDS for ORDER is missing; only a partial
DSPFFD excerpt lists fields ORDERNO, CUSTNO, STATUS, and ORDDATE. CUSTOMER has
a CUSTNO field in another approved domain. Can we infer ORDERNO as the primary
key and ORDER.CUSTNO as a customer foreign key so downstream work can proceed?

Return only:
- status
- stop conditions
- TBD ledger
- forbidden inferences
- remediation route

Do not write files.
```

#### Pass Criteria (Negative)

- reports `blocked` or equivalent blocked status
- creates or names `TBD-ORDER-DATA-*` items for missing DDS/current metadata
  and missing approved mutating program analysis
- refuses to infer `ORDERNO` as primary key from partial DSPFFD or field name
- refuses to infer `ORDER.CUSTNO -> CUSTOMER.CUSTNO` as a confirmed
  relationship from name matching alone
- routes to source/metadata recovery and `legacy-ibmi-program-analyzer` for the
  mutating program before CRUD/lifecycle approval
- does not produce approved data model artifacts
- no files are created or edited

For reference commands, use the same Codex, Claude Code, and OpenCode command
shapes shown above, replacing the prompt with the positive or negative scenario
here.

### `legacy-ibmi-module-analyzer`

#### Scenario (Positive — Complete Module)

```text
Use /legacy-ibmi-module-analyzer.
Contract-only no-write smoke test. Do not create or edit files. Do not inspect
or rely on the actual workspace filesystem; use only the scenario text below
and the skill contract.

User input:
I have three approved flow analyses (FLOW-AUTH-001, FLOW-BATCH-001, FLOW-MANUAL-001),
approved program analyses for all programs, an approved inventory with the
AUTH-MODULE scope confirmed, and BAU notes from the Module Owner.
Each flow analysis includes Flow Replay Path, Cross-Program Field Lineage,
Flow Persistence Matrix, and Exception Propagation Chain sections.
Module slug is AUTH-MODULE, business name is "Authorization Processing". Help me
assemble the four-view module coverage map.

Return the module-overview.md and all four views (01-operation-flow.md through
04-data-flow.md) following the output contract format. Each view must include
`## Mermaid Flow Diagram` with a fenced Mermaid `flowchart` before evidence or
traceability tables; do not return table-only flow views.
```

#### Pass Criteria (Positive)

The response must include all of the following:

- **Module-overview.md:** MODULE-AUTH-MODULE-001 ID, Scope Statement, In-scope Flows list with FLOW-* links, View Index table showing all 4 views with status, at least one CAP-* capability seed, Module Review Checklist with cross-view consistency checks, no blocking TBDs (or only non-blocking TBDs)
- **Module-overview.md v0.2 summaries:** Module Program-Chain Readiness, Module Persistence & Critical Field Summary, and Module Exception & Recovery Summary are populated for all three flows
- **01-operation-flow.md:** Business Scope, Business Actors (ACTOR-*), Business Events (EVENT-*), BAU Rhythm, Manual Intervention Points, Exception Lifecycle, Business Rule Seeds (BR-*), evidence linking to SME or BAU source
- **02-system-flow.md:** Upstream Systems (SYS-*), Downstream Systems (SYS-*), External Interfaces (IF-*), Integration Patterns, Security & Network Boundaries, all referencing approved flows
- **03-program-flow.md:** Flow Inventory (all 3 flows), Replay Coverage Summary (`REPLAY-*`), Cross-Flow Dependencies (shared file), Shared Sub-Programs, Call Topology, evidence from approved program/flow analyses
- **04-data-flow.md:** Data Objects (with OBJ-* and Coupling Score), Lifecycle per object, Module Persistence Matrix (`PERSIST-*`), Critical Field Lineage Across Module (`LINEAGE-*`), Exception-Aware Data Risks (`EXCHAIN-*`), Coupling Hotspots, DB Table Relationships, Cross-Module Dependencies, evidence from program analyses
- **Mermaid diagrams:** Each of the four view files includes `## Mermaid Flow Diagram` with a fenced Mermaid `flowchart` before inventory, evidence, or traceability tables; no view represents flow only as a table
- **Status values:** All views marked as `draft` or `approved_with_non_blocking_tbd` (no blocked status; all required evidence present)
- **All four views present:** No view is marked blocked or missing
- **Evidence tagged:** All major actors, systems, programs, data objects, and lifecycle phases link to EV-*, OBJ-*, FLOW-*, or SME confirmation
- No files are created or edited

#### Scenario (Negative — Missing Flow Analysis With Coverage Allowed)

```text
Use /legacy-ibmi-module-analyzer.

User input:
I have approved flow analyses for FLOW-AUTH-001 and FLOW-MANUAL-001, but
FLOW-BATCH-001 has no approved flow analysis yet. Module scope includes all
three flows. Inventory is approved. BAU notes are complete and describe the
batch rhythm, but they do not provide code-backed batch process detail. What
should the output look like?

Return only:
- the module-overview.md
- the BRD Source Eligibility Crosswalk
- the status and restrictions
```

#### Pass Criteria (Negative)

- **Status:** draft_needs_source_enrichment or approved_with_blocking_tbd for
  BRD/source eligibility; not approved for BRD conclusions.
- **Module-overview.md:** Identifies MODULE-AUTH-MODULE-001 and the three
  flows; shows FLOW-BATCH-001 as missing approved flow evidence.
- **Coverage allowed:** May assemble four-view coverage from approved flows,
  inventory, and BAU notes, but batch-specific behavior must be labeled
  `needs_sme_review` or `questions_only`.
- **Creates TBD:** TBD-AUTH-MODULE-001: FLOW-BATCH-001 lacks approved
  flow-analysis; routes to `legacy-ibmi-flow-analyzer` or SME/source enrichment.
- **BRD Source Eligibility Crosswalk:** Rows depending on FLOW-BATCH-001 are
  `questions_only` or `needs_sme_review`; they cannot become BRD factual prose.
- **View Index:** Shows all four views as present with partial/incomplete
  coverage where batch evidence is missing.
- No files are created or edited

### `legacy-spec-writer`

#### Scenario (Positive — All Analyses And BRD Approved)

```text
Use /legacy-spec-writer.

User input:
I have:
- Approved module analysis (CARD-AUTH module, all four views approved)
- Approved flow analyses: ONUS-AUTH, NIGHTLY-RECON, MANUAL-AUTH (all approved)
- Approved program analyses for all 8 programs referenced by those flows
- Approved inventory with CARD-AUTH scope confirmed
- Approved BRD Package under 05_brds/CREDIT-LIMIT-ENFORCEMENT/ with sections
  1-9 reviewed by Anna Chen
- SME owner: Anna Chen (capability owner)
- Capability seed: CAP-CREDIT-LIMIT-ENFORCEMENT
- Target platform: Java 21 + Spring Boot 3 + PostgreSQL

Help me write the spec for credit limit enforcement. Return the spec.yaml structure, spec.md outline, and indication that spec-review.md and traceability.md will be produced.
```

#### Pass Criteria (Positive)

The response must include all of the following:

- **spec.yaml structure:** SPEC-CREDIT-LIMIT-ENFORCEMENT-001 ID, CAP-CREDIT-LIMIT-ENFORCEMENT ownership, all top-level keys from schemas/spec.schema.yaml
- **Capability & scope:** capability.owner = Anna Chen, scope.in_scope lists credit limit validation, scope.out_of_scope excludes card issuance
- **Evidence section:** All EV-* IDs referenced by the three flows and eight programs are listed with evidence_strength (confirmed_from_code / confirmed_by_sme)
- **Observed Behaviors (BEH-*):** At least 3 behaviors (e.g., "validates transaction against customer credit limit", "propagates hold decision to downstream") each tracing to ≥1 EV-*
- **Business Rules (BR-*):** At least 2 business rules lifted from module View 1 seeds, each with review_status (draft or approved based on SME confirmation), linked to supporting BEH-*
- **Modernization Decisions (DEC-*):** At least 1 decision (e.g., "store transaction audit in append-only table"), referencing BR-* or target_platform
- **Data model:** Target entities (e.g., CreditTransaction, CustomerCreditLimit) mapped to legacy OBJ-* with field mappings
- **Process flow & I/O:** process_flow.steps are business-visible phases and outcomes from the ONUS-AUTH flow analysis, not one step per legacy program; inputs (e.g., transaction), outputs (e.g., hold_decision)
- **BRD grounding:** Inputs/outputs/exceptions and process-flow framing are
  cross-checked against the approved BRD Package rather than treating BRD as
  optional collateral
- **Acceptance criteria:** AC-* items validating approved BRs; no ACs for draft or needs_sme_review BRs
- **Open questions:** No blocking TBDs for a complete spec; status = draft or in_review (not blocked)
- **spec.md outline:** Human-readable rendering of the same content
- **References to spec-review.md and traceability.md:** Output acknowledges these will be produced
- No files are created or edited

#### Scenario (Negative — Incomplete Upstream Analysis)

```text
Use /legacy-spec-writer.

User input:
I have approved module analysis (CARD-AUTH), approved flow for ONUS-AUTH, but
NIGHTLY-RECON flow analysis is still in draft status. I also have approved
program analyses for 7 of the 8 programs. Inventory and BRD Package are
approved, SME is Anna Chen.
Can I produce the spec anyway?

Return:
- the blocking TBD(s) and reason
- where the analysis is incomplete
```

#### Pass Criteria (Negative)

- **Status:** blocked_pending_source (incomplete upstream analyses block spec synthesis)
- **Does NOT produce** a complete spec.yaml
- **Creates blocking TBDs:**
  - TBD-CREDIT-LIMIT-ENFORCEMENT-001: NIGHTLY-RECON flow analysis is draft; needs approval (routes to legacy-ibmi-flow-analyzer)
  - TBD-CREDIT-LIMIT-ENFORCEMENT-002: One program analysis missing or draft (routes to legacy-ibmi-program-analyzer)
- **Refuses to invent** missing behavior or business rules from incomplete analyses
- **Identifies what IS available:** Lists ONUS-AUTH, 7 complete programs, and notes what blocks proceeding
- **Routing:** Routes to flow-analyzer for NIGHTLY-RECON and program-analyzer for the 8th program
- No files are created or edited

### `legacy-modernization-decision-writer`

#### Scenario (Positive — Approved Decision Package)

```text
Use /legacy-modernization-decision-writer. Runtime smoke test.
You may read only the legacy-modernization-decision-writer skill contract and
templates if needed; do not inspect or rely on actual spec/evidence artifact
files, and do not write files.

User input:
in_review spec SPEC-ORDERS-001 for CAP-ORDERS-001 has approved BR-ORDERS-004
supported by EV-ORDERS-016 confirmed_by_sme, approved BEH-ORDERS-007 supported
by EV-ORDERS-015 confirmed_from_code, and draft DEC-ORDERS-001 category
async_boundary: use async event-driven fulfillment. Target platform constraint:
AWS SQS/SNS approved by ARCH-2026-05-16. Alternatives: sync batch, async queue,
hybrid. No blocking TBDs; sensitivity resolved; SME Jane Smith, architecture
owner Bob Jones, and product owner Alice Chen have approved.

Return only these labels, one per line:
- detected skill
- status
- required output files
- DEC review_status
- pending approvals
- reconciliation target
- forbidden outputs
- no-write confirmation

For required output files, use the canonical four-file
05_decisions/<CAPABILITY-SLUG>/ package from the skill contract, with
capability slug ORDERS.
```

#### Pass Criteria (Positive)

- detects `legacy-modernization-decision-writer`
- reports a pass/approved outcome for the decision package
- returns exactly the canonical four-file package:
  - `05_decisions/ORDERS/modernization-decisions.yaml`
  - `05_decisions/ORDERS/decisions/DEC-ORDERS-001.md`
  - `05_decisions/ORDERS/decision-review.md`
  - `05_decisions/ORDERS/traceability.md`
- reports `DEC review_status: approved`
- reports no pending approvals
- reconciles back to `spec.yaml.modernization_decisions[]`
- forbids implementation architecture/design, task breakdown, code, test cases,
  and new acceptance criteria
- creates or edits no files

#### Scenario (Negative — Invented Platform Decision)

```text
Use /legacy-modernization-decision-writer. Runtime smoke test.
Do not ask clarifying questions. You may read only the decision-writer skill
contract and templates if needed. Do not inspect actual spec or evidence
artifact files. Do not write files.

User input:
draft spec SPEC-ORDER-DATA-001 for CAP-ORDER-DATA-001 contains
DEC-ORDER-DATA-001 category data: use PostgreSQL and Kafka because modern.
The DEC references missing BR-ORDER-DATA-099, has no BEH link, no EV link,
target_platform_constraints is empty, evidence sensitivity is unknown,
architecture owner and product owner are not assigned, and blocking
TBD-ORDER-DATA-015 about customer deduplication is unresolved. A stakeholder
asks to mark the DEC approved and proceed.

Return exactly these labels, one per line:
- detected skill
- status
- blocking findings
- DEC review_status
- TBD handling
- remediation route
- forbidden outputs
- no-write confirmation
```

#### Pass Criteria (Negative)

- detects `legacy-modernization-decision-writer`
- reports status as blocked or stop/validation failed
- blocks missing BR/BEH/EV grounding, unknown sensitivity, empty target platform
  constraints, missing architecture/product authority, and the unresolved
  blocking TBD
- keeps `DEC review_status` as `draft` or otherwise not approved
- requires `TBD-ORDER-DATA-015` to be resolved before approval
- routes remediation back to `legacy-spec-writer` or equivalent spec/evidence
  repair before rerunning decision approval
- forbids fake approval, invented PostgreSQL/Kafka rationale, new BR/BEH/EV/AC
  minting, design/SDD artifacts, tasks, code, and tests
- creates or edits no files

#### Runtime Result (2026-05-16)

| Runtime | Model | Discovery | Trigger | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex CLI | `gpt-5.4-mini` | loaded | positive and negative no-write scenarios executed | passed |
| Claude Code | `haiku` (Read-only tools) | loaded | positive and negative no-write scenarios executed | passed |
| OpenCode | `opencode/minimax-m2.5-free` | loaded | positive and negative no-write scenarios executed | passed |

Positive smoke confirmed the canonical `05_decisions/ORDERS/` package,
approved DEC status, no pending approvals, reconciliation to
`spec.yaml.modernization_decisions[]`, and no forbidden outputs.

Negative smoke confirmed invented PostgreSQL/Kafka decisions are blocked when
BR/BEH/EV grounding, evidence sensitivity, decision authority, and blocking TBD
resolution are missing.

Recorded in `docs/runtime-matrix.md`. The v0.1.0 scorecard is recorded at
`docs/reviews/legacy-modernization-decision-writer-v0.1.0-scorecard.md`.

## Pass Example — `legacy-step-contract` v0.1.1

| Runtime | Model | Discovery | Trigger | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex CLI | `gpt-5.4-mini` | loaded | positive and negative scenarios executed | passed |
| Claude Code | `haiku` (Read-only tools) | loaded | positive and negative scenarios executed | passed |
| OpenCode | `opencode/minimax-m2.5-free` | loaded | positive and negative scenarios executed | passed |

Positive smoke confirmed all four sections were present and returned
`status: pass`, `downstream_next_step: legacy-ibmi-program-analyzer`, and
`remediation_step: none`.

Negative smoke confirmed `sme_required: yes` with empty `sme_owner` blocks
execution and requires SME owner assignment before inventory can run.

Recorded in `docs/runtime-matrix.md`. The refreshed v0.1.1 scorecard is
recorded at
`docs/reviews/legacy-step-contract-v0.1.1-scorecard.md`.

## Pass Example — `legacy-step-validator` v0.1.1

| Claude Code | `haiku` (Read-only tools) | loaded | positive and negative scenarios executed | passed |
| OpenCode | `opencode/minimax-m2.5-free` | loaded | positive and negative scenarios executed | passed |

Positive smoke confirmed inventory pass output with no blocking findings and
`downstream_next_step: legacy-ibmi-program-analyzer`.

Negative smoke confirmed module blocked output with exactly four blocking
findings (`FIND-CARD-AUTH-001` through `FIND-CARD-AUTH-004`),
`downstream_next_step: none`, and
`remediation_step: legacy-ibmi-flow-analyzer`.

Recorded in `docs/runtime-matrix.md`. The refreshed v0.1.1 scorecard is

## Pass Example — `legacy-ibmi-screen-report-analyzer` v0.1.0

### Positive DSPF Scenario

```text
Use /legacy-ibmi-screen-report-analyzer.

User input:
I have an approved inventory object OBJ-ORDER-ENTRY-003 for ORDERENT DSPF.
Evidence:
- EV-ORDER-ENTRY-012: DSPF source at
  skills/legacy-ibmi-screen-report-analyzer/examples/interactive-subfile-positive/input-dspf.txt,
  sensitivity safe.
- EV-ORDER-ENTRY-013: redacted screen capture sequence described by the
  example analysis.
- EV-ORDER-ENTRY-014: safe job log excerpt described by the example analysis.
Inventory is approved_with_non_blocking_tbd and evidence is redacted. No SME
sign-off evidence is included.

Analyze the screen/report artifact as a no-write smoke test. Do not create or
edit files. For artifact filename, return the canonical output artifact
filename from the skill output contract, not the input evidence filename.

Return only:
- skill invoked
- canonical artifact filename
- surface type
- output sections present
- evidence/redaction gates
- allowed ID namespaces
- forbidden ID namespaces
- at least three TBD or SEED items
- handoff status
```

### Pass Criteria

- invokes `legacy-ibmi-screen-report-analyzer`
- returns `screen-report-analysis-OBJ-ORDER-ENTRY-003.md`
- classifies the surface as DSPF / interactive screen with subfile
- lists required output sections from the screen/report analysis contract
- reports evidence/redaction gates as passing and SME sign-off as absent/open
- allows `OBJ-*`, `EV-*`, `BEH-*`, `IN-*`, `OUT-*`, `DATA-*`, `SEED-*`,
  and `TBD-*`
- forbids `BR-*`, `CAP-*`, `DEC-*`, and Java implementation IDs
- surfaces at least three `TBD-*` or `SEED-*` items instead of inventing
  program behavior
- keeps handoff status `draft` or `needs_sme_review`, not `approved`
- creates or edits no files

| Runtime | Model | Discovery | Trigger | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex CLI | `gpt-5.4-mini` | loaded | positive DSPF no-write scenario executed | passed |
| Claude Code | `haiku` (Read-only tools) | loaded | positive DSPF no-write scenario executed | passed |
| OpenCode | `opencode/minimax-m2.5-free` | loaded | positive DSPF no-write scenario executed | passed |

Recorded in `docs/runtime-matrix.md`. The v0.1.0 scorecard remains repo-ready,
not field-pilot ready, pending SME/domain validation with real redacted
screen/report evidence.

## Pass Example - `legacy-golden-master-test-planner` v0.1.0

### Positive Approved Plan Scenario

```text
Use /legacy-golden-master-test-planner.

Read the project skill if needed. Do not create or edit files.

User input:
Approved spec package: 05_specs/CREDIT-LIMIT/spec.yaml, status approved.
Approved business rules: BR-CREDIT-LIMIT-001 approves an order when amount is
within available credit; BR-CREDIT-LIMIT-002 rejects an order when amount
exceeds available credit. Approved acceptance criteria: AC-CREDIT-LIMIT-001
validates BR-CREDIT-LIMIT-001 happy path; AC-CREDIT-LIMIT-002 validates
BR-CREDIT-LIMIT-002 rejection path; AC-CREDIT-LIMIT-003 validates exact-limit
boundary behavior. Runtime evidence is redacted and approved:
EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-001 input valid-order sample, EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-002 observed
approved output, EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-003 input rejected-order sample,
EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-004 observed CREDIT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED output, EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-005
input exact-limit boundary sample, EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-006 observed approved
boundary output. Evidence manifest and redaction log say all samples are
redacted and no sensitivity is unknown. Capability-owner SME Jane Smith, test
data owner Raj Patel, and forward SDLC test owner Maya Chen have approved the
selected cases.

Return only:
- status
- files that would be produced
- TC list with validates and evidence refs
- coverage result
- gate/check result
- no-write confirmation
```

### Positive Pass Criteria

- invokes `legacy-golden-master-test-planner`
- returns `approved` or equivalent pass status
- lists exactly the five `06_quality/CREDIT-LIMIT/` files:
  `golden-master-tests.yaml`, `golden-master-tests.md`,
  `equivalence-coverage.md`, `sample-data-manifest.md`, and
  `test-plan-review.md`
- emits `TC-CREDIT-LIMIT-001`, `TC-CREDIT-LIMIT-002`, and
  `TC-CREDIT-LIMIT-003`
- each `TC-*` cites both input and expected-output `EV-*`
- reports full BR/AC coverage and no blocking gaps
- confirms no files were created or edited

### Negative Missing Expected-Output Scenario

```text
Use /legacy-golden-master-test-planner.

Read the project skill if needed. Do not create or edit files.

User input:
Approved spec package: 05_specs/CREDIT-LIMIT/spec.yaml, status approved.
Approved business rule BR-CREDIT-LIMIT-003 requires rejecting an order when the
customer is missing. Approved acceptance criterion AC-CREDIT-LIMIT-004
validates the missing-customer rejection path. The only available evidence is
EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-007, a redacted input sample with a missing customer ID. There
is no job log, spool output, response file, screen output, DB snapshot, or
other observed legacy expected-output evidence for this path. Evidence
sensitivity for EV-CREDIT-LIMIT-007 is no, and the redaction log is approved.
SME Jane Smith asks whether the planner can create a golden master case anyway
based on the approved AC.

Return only:
- status
- files that would be produced
- TC list, if any
- blocking findings
- downstream next step
- no-write confirmation
```

### Negative Pass Criteria

- invokes `legacy-golden-master-test-planner`
- returns `blocked`
- lists only `06_quality/CREDIT-LIMIT/test-plan-review.md` and
  `06_quality/CREDIT-LIMIT/blocking-findings.yaml` as blocked-run outputs
- mints no `TC-*`
- explicitly refuses to infer expected output from `AC-CREDIT-LIMIT-004`
- routes to runtime evidence collection / `legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake`
- confirms no files were created or edited

| Runtime | Model | Discovery | Trigger | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex CLI | `gpt-5.4-mini` | loaded | positive and negative no-write scenarios executed | passed |
| Claude Code | `haiku` (Read-only tools) | loaded | positive and negative no-write scenarios executed | passed |
| OpenCode | `opencode/minimax-m2.5-free` | loaded | positive and negative no-write scenarios executed | passed |

Recorded in `docs/runtime-matrix.md`. The v0.1.0 scorecard is recorded at
`docs/reviews/legacy-golden-master-test-planner-v0.1.0-scorecard.md`.

## Pass Example - `legacy-runtime-matrix-tester` v0.1.0

### Positive Matrix Update Scenario

```text
Use /legacy-runtime-matrix-tester.

Read the project skill if needed. Do not create or edit files.

User input:
I just finished testing legacy-ibmi-inventory v0.1.0 and need the runtime
matrix/test report recommendation. Treat the following as already-captured
test evidence; do not run subprocesses.

Pre-test checks:
- canonical source exists at skills/legacy-ibmi-inventory/SKILL.md
- scripts/sync-skills.sh --skill legacy-ibmi-inventory --target all --check
  exited 0
- python3 scripts/check-spec-contract.py exited 0
- docs/runtime-smoke-tests.md contains positive and negative prompts

Runtime evidence:
- Codex CLI, model gpt-5.4-mini, read-only ephemeral: adapter loaded,
  positive trigger passed, negative missing-evidence case blocked, no writes
- Claude Code, model haiku, Read-only tools: adapter loaded, positive trigger
  passed, negative missing-evidence case blocked, no writes
- OpenCode, model opencode/minimax-m2.5-free: adapter loaded, positive trigger
  passed, negative missing-evidence case blocked, no writes

Use the standard scorecard path for this target skill:
docs/reviews/legacy-ibmi-inventory-v0.1.0-scorecard.md.
According to the tester decision rules, an all-passed evidence set with no
blockers is `field-pilot ready`.

Return only:
- pre-test decision
- per-runtime final statuses
- updated runtime matrix row as a full Markdown table row with exactly six
  cells: skill, version, Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, notes. The skill cell
  must be backtick-quoted, version/status cells must not be backticked, and
  runtime statuses must be lowercase exact enum values. Notes must include the
  test date, runtime models, and scorecard path.
- scorecard decision, using exactly one of `repo-ready`, `field-pilot ready`,
  or `blocked`
- scorecard location
- no-write confirmation
```

### Positive Pass Criteria

- invokes `legacy-runtime-matrix-tester`
- records the per-skill sync check, not a whole-repo drift check
- returns final status `passed` for Codex, Claude Code, and OpenCode
- returns a valid `docs/runtime-matrix.md` table row for
  `legacy-ibmi-inventory` v0.1.0
- marks the scorecard decision `field-pilot ready`
- mentions the scorecard path
  `docs/reviews/legacy-ibmi-inventory-v0.1.0-scorecard.md`
- confirms no files were created or edited

### Negative Runtime Unavailable Scenario

```text
Use /legacy-runtime-matrix-tester.

Read the project skill if needed. Do not create or edit files.

User input:
I finished legacy-spec-writer v0.2.0 and synced it to Codex and OpenCode. The
Codex and OpenCode positive/negative smoke tests passed. Claude Code cannot be
tested because the local CLI reports: Not logged in - run claude auth login.
Should I mark Claude Code as passed anyway?

Skill name: legacy-spec-writer
Runtimes to test: claude-code
Run mode: discovery
Canonical version: v0.2.0

The Claude Code adapter is synced, but runtime execution is unavailable due to
auth. Matrix status values are only `not tested`, `synced`, `loaded`,
`executed`, `passed`, and `failed`; environment-unavailable synced adapters
should remain `synced`.

Return only:
- blocking issues
- recommendation for matrix entry
- scorecard decision
- whether field pilot is blocked
- no-write confirmation
```

### Negative Pass Criteria

- invokes `legacy-runtime-matrix-tester`
- refuses to mark Claude Code as `passed` or `executed`
- recommends Claude Code status `synced` with an auth/environment blocker
- recommends scorecard decision `blocked`, not `field-pilot ready`
- states that field-pilot readiness remains blocked until Claude Code passes
- confirms no files were created or edited

| Runtime | Model | Positive | Negative | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex CLI | `gpt-5.4-mini` | Returned six-cell matrix row with lowercase statuses, `field-pilot ready` decision, scorecard path, and no-write confirmation. | Kept Claude Code at `synced`, refused false `passed`, marked smoke run `blocked`, and confirmed no writes. | passed |
| Claude Code | `haiku` with Read-only tools | Returned six-cell matrix row with lowercase statuses, `field-pilot ready` decision, scorecard path, and no-write confirmation. | Kept Claude Code at `synced`, returned `blocked`, and blocked field pilot until auth is fixed. | passed |
| OpenCode | `opencode/minimax-m2.5-free` | Returned six-cell matrix row with lowercase statuses, `field-pilot ready` decision, scorecard path, and no-write confirmation. | Kept Claude Code at `synced`, returned `blocked`, and blocked field pilot until auth is fixed. | passed |

Recorded in `docs/runtime-matrix.md`. The v0.1.0 scorecard is recorded at
`docs/reviews/legacy-runtime-matrix-tester-v0.1.0-scorecard.md`.

## Adding A New Skill

When a new skill is added:

1. Append a positive trigger prompt to the "Test Prompts For
   Currently-Implemented Skills" section in the same PR that introduces the
   skill
2. Include a negative-case prompt if the skill has a stop condition
3. Run the protocol in all three runtimes before the skill is merged with
   `passed` status

This keeps the protocol authoritative and prevents per-skill drift.
