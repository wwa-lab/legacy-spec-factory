# Output Contract: Module Analysis

This document defines the precise file shape and required fields for each
of the six artifacts in `02_modules/<MODULE-SLUG>/`.

The canonical model is in `../../../docs/module-analysis-model.md`. This
document defines the *file format*; that document defines the *intent*.

## Review Checklist — View 1

Per the SME Review Questions in SKILL.md, the reviewer should verify:

- [ ] **Business actors complete?** All roles interacting with the module are named; no inferred actors (e.g., "probably marketing uses this")
- [ ] **BAU rhythm correct?** Cut-off times, peak hours, seasonal patterns match operational reality
- [ ] **Exception procedures accurate?** Manual intervention points and escalation paths match how the team actually handles failures
- [ ] **Business-rule seeds reasonable?** Seeds are phrased as open questions, not invented rules
- [ ] **Evidence linked?** Every major actor, event, BAU cadence, and intervention links to SME confirmation or source document
- [ ] **No code-hallucinations?** No procedures, actors, or timing derived solely from program names / table names

## Status: draft | needs_sme_review | approved | approved_with_non_blocking_tbd | blocked_pending_source | rejected

## Data Objects in Scope
(Aggregated from every program's Object Dependencies section.)

| Object | Type | Inventory ID | Producer Flows | Consumer Flows | Coupling Score | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TXNLOGPF | PF | OBJ-CARD-AUTH-050 | FLOW-ONUS-AUTH, FLOW-MANUAL-AUTH | FLOW-NIGHTLY-RECON | 3 (HIGH) | EV |

| Object | Created By | Updated By | Read By | Archived By | Purged By |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TXNLOGPF | FLOW-ONUS-AUTH (per transaction) | (none — append-only) | FLOW-NIGHTLY-RECON, FLOW-MANUAL-AUTH | (monthly archive job — out of module) | (yearly purge — out of module) |

## Coupling Hotspots (Modernization Risks)
| Object | Coupling Score | Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TXNLOGPF | HIGH (3 flows) | Schema change ripples through all flows | Maintain backward compatibility; version transactions |

## Critical Data Trails
[End-to-end paths of important data — e.g., a transaction record from
intake → log → GL posting → archive.]

## DB Table Relationships
[ER-style diagram or table listing PK/FK relationships among the module's
PF / LF / SQL tables.]

## Cross-Module Data Dependencies
| Object | Owned By Module | Used By This Module | Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CUSTMSTR | CUSTOMER-MASTER module | CARD-AUTH (read-only lookup) | Direct CHAIN |
| GLPOSTPF | (this module produces; GL consumes) | n/a | File handoff |

## Review Checklist — View 4

Per the SME Review Questions in SKILL.md, the reviewer should verify:

- [ ] **Data lifecycle correct?** Created / Updated / Read / Archived / Purged lifecycle per object matches code evidence and BAU (View 1)
- [ ] **Coupling hotspots match reality?** HIGH coupling scores point to objects that are actually "scary to change" in operations
- [ ] **Cross-module dependencies identified?** Every object consumed by another module or producing for external systems is listed
- [ ] **DB relationships documented?** PK/FK, versioning, and archival strategy are clear
- [ ] **Evidence linked?** Each object and lifecycle phase references an EV-* ID, OBJ-* ID, or FLOW-* from approved analyses
- [ ] **No hallucinated fields?** Coupling scores and lifecycle phases derived solely from code and flow evidence, not speculation
