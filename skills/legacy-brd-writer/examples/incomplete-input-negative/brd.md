**Document ID:** `BRD-ORDER-ROUTING-001`  
**Capability ID:** `CAP-ORDER-ROUTING-001`  
**Module ID:** `MODULE-ORDER-PROCESS-001`  
**Module Analysis Source:** `04_modules/order-process/`  
**Status:** `blocked`

## 1. Capability Overview

### Scope Statement

**In Scope:**
- Order routing to fulfillment centers
- Shipping method selection

**Out of Scope:**
- `<To be confirmed with SME>`

### Business Owner

- **Name / Role:** Sarah Lee, Order Fulfillment Manager
- **Contact:** sarah.lee@company.com

### Business Value

Orders must be routed efficiently to the appropriate fulfillment center to
minimize shipping cost and delivery time.

### Scope Clarification Need

The SME must confirm whether this BRD covers only fulfillment-center assignment
or also shipping-method selection, manual override, and exception handling.
This boundary issue is tracked as `TBD-ORDER-ROUTING-001`.

---

## 2. As-Is Business Process Summary

### Business Trigger

An order is submitted and needs assignment to a fulfillment path.

### Business Participants and Systems

- **Primary business party:** Customer awaiting fulfillment
- **System role:** Selects or proposes a fulfillment center and shipping method
- **External / downstream party:** Fulfillment center and shipping operations

### Current-State Flow

1. The order enters the routing capability.
2. The system appears to select a fulfillment center.
3. The business basis for the selection is not confirmed from available
   evidence.

### Business Outcomes and Controls

- **Normal outcome:** Not safe to state; available evidence does not confirm the
  routing decision logic.
- **Exception outcome:** Not confirmed from available evidence.
- **Control or audit point:** Not confirmed from available evidence.

### Implementation Evidence Boundary

Available evidence exposes routine names and comments but not enough business
meaning. The unresolved business purpose is captured as blocking TBDs instead
of being filled in from technical names.

---

## 3. Observed Behaviors

### BEH-ORDER-ROUTING-001: Fulfillment Center Selection

**Statement:** When an order is submitted, the system determines which
fulfillment center should process the order.

**Evidence:** `EV-ORDER-ROUTING-001` (program analysis section 2.1)

**Knowledge Type:** `observed_behavior`  
**Confidence:** `medium`

**Issue:** The program analysis describes the routine name
(`SELECT-FULFILLMENT-CENTER`) but does not include the actual control flow
logic. See TBD-001.

---

### BEH-ORDER-ROUTING-002: Geographic Assignment

**Statement:** Orders are assigned based on geographic location.

**Evidence:** `EV-ORDER-ROUTING-002` (program analysis section 2.2 - comment
mentions "geographic logic")

**Knowledge Type:** `unknown_tbd`  
**Confidence:** `low`

**Issue:** Only a code comment supports this. No actual logic or data lookup is
documented. See TBD-002.

---

## 4. Inferred Business Rules

### BR-ORDER-ROUTING-001: Fulfillment Center Optimization

**Statement:** The system should assign orders to the fulfillment center that
minimizes total shipping cost and delivery time.

**Rationale:** Inferred from module overview's capability seed and business
context.

**Evidence:** Module BR-* seed; no specific EV support yet.

**Knowledge Type:** `inferred_business_rule`  
**Confidence:** `low`  
**Review Status:** `needs_sme_review`

**SME Notes:** Awaiting SME confirmation — is this a real business rule or an
aspiration?

---

## 5. Validation Scenario Summary

See `validation-scenarios.md` for deferred scenario notes. No `VAL-*` scenario
seed is safe to draft yet because the available evidence does not support a
business validation scenario without inventing routing logic.

---

## 6. Open Questions & Gaps (TBDs)

### TBD-ORDER-ROUTING-001: Missing Program Flow Details

**Category:** `evidence_gaps`  
**Statement:** The program analysis for `SELECT-FULFILLMENT-CENTER` routine
only provides a routine name and a comment. The actual control flow logic
(which attributes drive routing? what is the algorithm?) is not extracted.

**Evidence:** `EV-ORDER-ROUTING-001` is incomplete.

**Resolver:** `Program Analyzer` (needs to run detailed analysis)  
**Blocking:** `yes` (cannot write BRD without understanding the logic)

**Context:** This blocks understanding observed behavior. Need either:
1. Detailed program analysis with control flow, or
2. SME confirmation of the routing logic if program is too complex to analyze

---

### TBD-ORDER-ROUTING-002: Geographic Logic Not Evidenced

**Category:** `evidence_gaps`  
**Statement:** The claim that orders are assigned by "geographic location" is
based only on a code comment. No actual geographic lookup logic is visible
(e.g., ZIP code comparison, regional database query).

**Evidence:** Only `EV-ORDER-ROUTING-002` (comment); no logic evidence.

**Resolver:** `Program Analyzer` or `SME`  
**Blocking:** `yes` (cannot claim behavior without code evidence)

**Context:** Either:
1. Program analysis should show the actual geographic lookup logic, or
2. SME should confirm whether geographic assignment is real or a comment error

---

### TBD-ORDER-ROUTING-003: Missing Flow Analysis

**Category:** `missing_inputs`  
**Statement:** Module analysis references flow `flow-ORDER-ROUTING` but no
approved flow analysis has been provided. Without the flow, we cannot
understand cross-program data flow or error handling.

**Evidence:** Module overview cites `FLOW-ORDER-ROUTING-001` but file not found.

**Resolver:** `Flow Analyzer` (needs to complete flow-ORDER-ROUTING.md)  
**Blocking:** `yes` (missing upstream input; BRD cannot proceed)

**Context:** Wait for flow analysis before completing BRD.

---

### TBD-ORDER-ROUTING-004: Shipping Method vs. Fulfillment Center

**Category:** `sme_questions`  
**Statement:** Is "shipping method selection" (in-scope per BRD) the same
routing algorithm as "fulfillment center selection", or are they separate
decisions?

**Evidence:** Scope statement lists shipping method, but BRD behaviors only
mention fulfillment center.

**Resolver:** `SME`  
**Blocking:** `yes` (scope ambiguity)

**Context:** Need SME to clarify scope before BRD can be completed.

---

### TBD-ORDER-ROUTING-005: Performance or Cost Optimization

**Category:** `sme_questions`  
**Statement:** Is the routing rule "minimize cost", "minimize delivery time",
or "balance both"? BR-001 is unclear on the optimization objective.

**Evidence:** BR-001 mentions both; module seed does not specify.

**Resolver:** `SME`  
**Blocking:** `yes` (business rule cannot be approved without clarity)

**Context:** SME must specify the business objective before BRD can move to
approved.

## 7. Evidence Index

| ID | Source | Type | Sensitivity | Strength | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EV-ORDER-ROUTING-001` | `program-analysis-ORDER-ROUTING-001.md`, section 2.1 | program analysis | `public` | `confirmed_from_code` | Incomplete; only routine name and comment extracted |
| `EV-ORDER-ROUTING-002` | `program-analysis-ORDER-ROUTING-001.md`, section 2.2 | program analysis | `public` | `weakly_inferred` | Code comment only; no logic shown |

---

## 8. Traceability Summary

**Status:** `BLOCKED — cannot proceed to SME review**

**Blocking Issues:**
1. Flow analysis not provided (TBD-003) — missing upstream input
2. Program flow logic not detailed (TBD-001) — insufficient evidence
3. Geographic logic not shown (TBD-002) — comment only, no code evidence
4. Scope ambiguity (TBD-004) — SME must clarify
5. Business rule unclear (TBD-005) — SME must specify optimization objective

**Next Steps:**
1. Obtain approved `flow-ORDER-ROUTING.md` from flow analyzer
2. Request detailed program analysis for `SELECT-FULFILLMENT-CENTER` with
   control flow
3. Escalate to SME to clarify scope and optimization objective
4. Do NOT proceed to SME review until blocking TBDs are resolved
