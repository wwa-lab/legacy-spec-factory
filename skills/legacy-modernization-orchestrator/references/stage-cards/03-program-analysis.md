# Stage 03: Program Analysis (one program at a time)

**You are here if:** inventory is approved AND you want to analyze one
program's behavior (control flow, file I/O, calls, error handling) before
tracing the full call chain.

You will produce **one program-analysis file per in-scope program**. Loop
through programs one at a time before moving to flow analysis.

## Need before starting

- `01_inventory/inventory.yaml` with `sme_review.decision: approved`
  (or `approved_with_non_blocking_tbd`)
- Redacted source member for the target program
- Any referenced copybook / service-program interfaces
- File list and called objects from `inventory.yaml`

## Run

- **Skill:** `legacy-ibmi-program-analyzer` (Implemented v0.1.0)
- **Manual fallback:** Use the program-analysis skeleton in
  `skills/legacy-ibmi-program-analyzer/references/` and fill it section by
  section against the source

Optional companions (run in parallel when applicable):

- `legacy-ibmi-runtime-evidence-miner` — strengthen evidence with job logs
- `legacy-ibmi-screen-report-analyzer` — for DSPF / PRTF / subfile programs
- `legacy-ibmi-data-model-analyzer` — for domain data model

## Produce

- **Artifact:** `program-analysis.md` (one per program)
- **Save under:**
  `02_programs/<MODULE-SLUG>/<OBJ-PROGRAM>/program-analysis.md`
  *(relative to your `project.root`)*
  e.g. `docs/XXX260004-demo/02_programs/CREDIT-CHECK/ORDENTR/program-analysis.md`
- **Consumed by:** `legacy-ibmi-flow-analyzer`

Required sections: Metadata, Entry Points, Control Flow, File I/O, External
Calls, Error Handling, Open Questions (TBD-*). Every row cites an
`evidence_id`.

## Gate before advancing

- **Name:** (none specific to this stage) — advancement is gated by
  **coverage**: every in-scope program from inventory must have an
  approved `program-analysis.md` before flow analysis is complete
- **Check:** count of `program-analysis.md` files == count of in-scope
  programs in `inventory.yaml`
- **Blocks if:** any in-scope program is missing analysis OR any analysis
  has `review_status: needs_sme_review` for a money / inventory /
  compliance / customer-status branch

## SME action

- **Required:** for any branch affecting money, inventory, compliance,
  customer status, or posting
- **Ask:** "Is this branch's observed behavior correct in production? Are
  any conditions or exceptions missing?"
- **Recorded in:** `program-analysis.md` → `review_status` per row +
  `Open Questions` table

## Next card

[`04-flow-analysis.md`](04-flow-analysis.md) — once every in-scope program
has an approved analysis.
