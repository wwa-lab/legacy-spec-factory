description: Normalize external RAG or code-knowledge-graph output and human-confirmed four-view module context into a traceable `00_context_packages/<MODULE-SLUG>/` package. Use when a team already has module-first context, RAG hydration output, source snippets, field dictionary mappings, impact scope, contradictions, retrieval gaps, or four reviewed module flows and needs a safe handoff to `legacy-ibmi-module-analyzer` or BRD preparation. Blocks on unauthorized or unredacted evidence, missing module scope, hidden contradictions, or attempts to promote RAG candidates into approved business rules.

# Legacy Module Context Intake

## Purpose

Turn external RAG / code knowledge graph output plus human-confirmed module
context into a portable, evidence-tagged context package:

```text
00_context_packages/<MODULE-SLUG>/
|-- context-index.yaml
|-- 01-operation-business-flow.md
|-- 02-system-flow.md
|-- 03-program-flow.md
|-- 04-data-flow.md
|-- rag-evidence-map.md
|-- contradiction-log.md
`-- open-questions.md
```

This skill is a **module-first intake bridge**. It makes RAG output usable by
Legacy Spec Factory, but it does not approve business rules, replace source
analysis, or bypass SME review.

## Use This Skill When

- A team supplies a business module or subsystem context before running the
  usual program-by-program reverse chain.
- External RAG output includes `rag-run-index.yaml`, source snippets, field
  dictionary mappings, impact scope, contradictions, or retrieval gaps.
- The user asks to ingest, normalize, package, or prepare a RAG output bundle
  under `00_context_packages/<MODULE-SLUG>/`.
- A BRD or module analysis should start from human-confirmed four-view context
  instead of from raw source only.

## Do Not Use This Skill When

- The user only has raw IBM i source, DDS, job logs, spool, or DB extracts with
  unknown authorization or sensitivity. Route to `legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake`.
- The user wants an approved module analysis. Route the finished context
  package to `legacy-ibmi-module-analyzer`.
- The user wants `spec.yaml` or final `BR-*` rules. Route through
  `legacy-ibmi-module-analyzer`, `legacy-brd-writer`, and
  `legacy-spec-writer`.
- The task is to build or query the external RAG system itself. This skill
  consumes file-based RAG output only.

## Required Inputs

- Module slug, business name, and scope statement.
- Human-confirmed or explicitly draft four-view module context:
  Operation / Business Flow, System Flow, Program Flow, and Data Flow.
- RAG output bundle when available, preferably with:
  - `rag-run-index.yaml`
  - `flow-hydration-summary.md`
  - `source-snippets.md`
  - `field-dictionary-context.md`
  - `impact-scope.md`
  - `contradictions.md`
  - `retrieval-gaps.md`
- Evidence authorization signal for source/runtime content:
  - approved evidence manifest from `legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake`, or
  - explicit RAG metadata proving the bundle is synthetic, public,
    non-production, or otherwise approved for agent review.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and produce only blocking findings / requested remediation if any apply:

| Condition | Route |
| --- | --- |
| Source/runtime evidence sensitivity is unknown | `legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake` |
| Confidential evidence is present without approved redaction | `legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake` |
| Module slug, business name, or scope is missing | module owner / SME clarification |
| Four-view context is absent and cannot be reconstructed from supplied files | requester must provide module context or route to normal inventory/program/flow chain |
| RAG contradictions are missing, blank without evaluated checks, or hidden in prose | rerun / repair RAG bundle before intake |
| RAG candidate rules are requested as approved `BR-*` | block; candidates stay `needs_sme_review` seeds only |
| Source paths, snippet IDs, or dictionary IDs cannot be traced | record `TBD-*` in `open-questions.md`; do not smooth over |

## Output Contract

Use `references/output-contract.md` for required fields and examples. Use the
templates under `templates/` as scaffolding.

The package status in `context-index.yaml` must be one of:

- `ready_for_module_analysis`
- `ready_with_warnings`
- `blocked_pending_evidence`
- `blocked_pending_scope`
- `blocked_pending_contradiction_review`

Allowed handoff:

- `ready_for_module_analysis` or `ready_with_warnings` -> route to
  `legacy-ibmi-module-analyzer`.
- Any `blocked_*` status -> do not route downstream; list exact remediation in
  `open-questions.md` and `context-index.yaml`.

## Step Contract

This skill conforms to the Legacy Spec Factory Step Contract.

### Input

- **Required**: module slug, module business name, scope statement, four-view
  context or a RAG hydration summary that contains all four views, and evidence
  authorization for every source/runtime artifact referenced.
- **Optional**: approved evidence manifest, inventory, program analyses, flow
  analyses, SME notes, architecture diagrams, dictionary export, ARCAD REF
  export, runtime sample index.
- **Input readiness scoring**:
  - `0-5 blocked`: evidence authorization unresolved, module scope missing,
    contradictions missing, or no usable four-view context.
  - `6 minimum_pass`: module identity, four views, RAG provenance, and explicit
    open questions are present.
  - `7-8 usable`: source snippets, dictionary mappings, impact scope, and
    contradiction checks are traceable.
  - `9-10 strong`: approved evidence manifest, SME-reviewed four-view context,
    source/runtime snippets, dictionary ownership, and resolved high-severity
    contradictions are supplied.

### Execution

- **Procedure**: follow the Workflow below.
- **Allowed inference**: normalize and cross-link supplied context; derive
  evidence mappings from snippet tables; classify gaps and contradictions
  already present in the bundle.
- **Forbidden assumptions**: inventing module boundaries, systems, actors,
  flows, data owners, dictionary meanings, normal operating frequency,
  business rules, or modernization decisions.
- **ID policy**: may mint `TBD-*` and reuse upstream `RAG-*`, `SNP-*`, `RUN-*`,
  `DD-*`, `EV-*`, `FLOW-*`, `OBJ-*`, `MODULE-*`, and `VIEW-*`. Do not mint
  final `BR-*`, `CAP-*`, `DEC-*`, `AC-*`, or `TC-*`.

### Output

- **Canonical directory**: `00_context_packages/<MODULE-SLUG>/`.
- **Required files**: the eight files listed in Purpose.
- **Required gates**: evidence authorization, provenance completeness,
  contradiction visibility, four-view coverage, and open-question carry-forward.
- **Handoff status**: only `ready_for_module_analysis` and
  `ready_with_warnings` may feed `legacy-ibmi-module-analyzer`.

### Validation

- **Mechanical**: all required files exist; `context-index.yaml` names every
  input bundle and output file; every RAG evidence ID referenced in a view is
  listed in `rag-evidence-map.md`; every contradiction/gap has an owner or
  routing destination.
- **Semantic**: no RAG candidate is promoted to an approved business rule; all
  claims preserve knowledge type and evidence strength; contradictory evidence
  remains visible.
- **SME / human approval**: module owner confirms business name and scope;
  data owner or dictionary owner confirms approved dictionary mappings where
  they are used as business terminology.

## Workflow

1. **Resolve module identity**
   - Confirm `MODULE-SLUG`, business name, scope statement, and module owner.
   - Normalize slug to uppercase hyphenated form without renumbering existing
     IDs.

2. **Check evidence authorization**
   - Read RAG sensitivity/provenance metadata and any evidence manifest.
   - Block if source/runtime artifacts are not approved for agent review.

3. **Inventory RAG bundle files**
   - Record each supplied input in `context-index.yaml`.
   - Capture run ID, source snapshot, dictionary version, ARCAD REF snapshot,
     corpus root, and generation timestamp when present.

4. **Normalize four views**
   - Create one Markdown file per view using the supplied module context.
   - Every factual claim must include a source row, evidence ID, or SME note.
   - Keep candidate rules as candidates or seeds, never approved rules.

5. **Build evidence map**
   - Convert source snippets, runtime observations, dictionary mappings, and
     impact-scope rows into `rag-evidence-map.md`.
   - Preserve original IDs such as `SNP-*`, `RUN-*`, `DD-*`, `RAG-CAND-*`, and
     `RAG-CONFLICT-*`.

6. **Carry contradictions forward**
   - Copy every contradiction into `contradiction-log.md`.
   - If the RAG bundle says no contradictions exist, include the evaluated
     checks that justify that result.

7. **Carry gaps and assumptions forward**
   - Convert retrieval gaps, missing mappings, and non-blocking assumptions
     into `open-questions.md`.
   - Mint `TBD-*` only for questions that need Legacy Spec Factory tracking.

8. **Set handoff decision**
   - If any hard gate failed, set a `blocked_*` status and name the upstream
     owner.
   - Otherwise set `ready_for_module_analysis` or `ready_with_warnings` and
     route to `legacy-ibmi-module-analyzer`.

## Handoff To Module Analyzer

When the package is ready, tell the next agent:

```text
Use legacy-ibmi-module-analyzer with
00_context_packages/<MODULE-SLUG>/ as module-first context.
Treat RAG snippets and runtime observations as evidence context only.
Preserve contradiction-log.md and open-questions.md as TBD inputs.
Do not promote candidate rules without SME review.
```
