## Recommended Next Prompt

This package is blocked pending resolution of RAG-CONFLICT-PAYMENT-MATCH-001.

Do NOT route to legacy-ibmi-module-analyzer until the contradiction is resolved.

Required action:
1. Present TBD-PAYMENT-MATCH-001 to AR Operations SME for a ruling on
   matching frequency (daily EOD vs weekly batch).
2. Update contradiction-log.md with SME ruling and evidence.
3. Clear TBD-PAYMENT-MATCH-001 from blocking_items in context-index.yaml.
4. Update intake.status to ready_for_module_analysis or ready_with_warnings.
5. Re-run the validator:
   skills/legacy-module-context-intake/scripts/validate_context_package.py \
     00_context_packages/PAYMENT-MATCH/
6. Then route to legacy-ibmi-module-analyzer.
```
