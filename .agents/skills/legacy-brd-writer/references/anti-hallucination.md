# Anti-Hallucination Rules for BRD Writing

The BRD is the **first business-facing layer** of the modernization pipeline. It
is tempting to "fill in the blanks" or make reasonable-sounding inferences. This
document lists specific traps and how to avoid them.

---

## Core Principle: Ground Truth is Evidence

A claim is only safe to include in the BRD if it traces back to **evidence** (EV-*)
from one of these sources:

1. **Tier 1 (Strong)**: Source code, data structure, runtime behavior
2. **Tier 2 (Strong)**: Named, date-stamped SME confirmation
3. **Higher Tiers** (Weak or Invalid): Comments, field names, inferred naming,
   wikis, prior specs

**If you cannot link a claim to Tier 1 or Tier 2 evidence, it must be a TBD,
not a confident statement in the BRD.**

---

## Hallucination Traps

### 0. Treating the Runtime Chain as the BRD

**Trap:**
```
Flow analysis lists programs A -> B -> C.
BRD author copies that sequence into "As-Is Summary" and adds file names,
commit/rollback behavior, and interface-library movement.
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- A call sequence proves technical execution order, not business meaning
- SMEs need to validate purpose, outcomes, controls, exceptions, and policy
- Program names and file names are evidence anchors, not the conversation model

**What to do instead:**
1. Translate the chain into business phases such as intake, eligibility,
   execution, external handoff, response reconciliation, exception reporting
2. State what business object changes state in each phase
3. Move program/object names to evidence, traceability, or appendix notes
4. If the business purpose of a handoff is unclear, create a `TBD-*`:
   ```yaml
   id: TBD-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001
   category: sme_questions
   statement: "What business decision, control, or handoff does this technical
              step represent?"
   resolver: SME
   blocking: yes
   ```

### 1. Inventing Business Rules from Naming

**Trap:**
```
A field is called `IS_APPROVED`. 
Inference: "The system tracks approval status."
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- The field might always be 'Y' (set once, never read)
- It might be vestigial code (left over from a feature that was never completed)
- The actual approval logic might be elsewhere

**What to do instead:**
1. Check if the field is read in any conditional logic
2. Check if the field is written to or only populated once
3. If the approval logic is unclear, create a TBD-*:
   ```yaml
   id: TBD-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-001
   category: sme_questions
   statement: "Is IS_APPROVED field actively used for approval decisions, 
              or is it legacy?"
   resolver: SME
   blocking: yes
   ```

---

### 2. Assuming Code Comments Are Accurate

**Trap:**
```
Code has comment: "// Check credit limit"
Inference: "The system enforces credit limits"
Without checking: Does the code actually check? Is it a TODO? Outdated?
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- Comments can be outdated
- Comments can describe intent, not actual behavior
- Comments might say "check X" but code checks "not X"

**What to do instead:**
1. Read the code logic, not the comment
2. If comment contradicts code, mark as TBD-*
3. Cite evidence as `confirmed_from_code` only if you read the actual logic

---

### 3. Assuming Field Names Imply Semantics

**Trap:**
```
Data model has fields: CRDAMT, CRDLIM, CRDSTS
Inference: "Credit amount, credit limit, credit status are tracked"
Without evidence: What do these fields contain? What are their valid values?
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- A field named `CRDAMT` might actually hold "credit account manager ID" (CRDT+A+MT)
- Without seeing the field definition or sample data, you cannot know the meaning
- Abbreviations are ambiguous

**What to do instead:**
1. Check the data definition (DDS, DDL, or DSPFFD output)
2. Check sample transaction data to see real values
3. If meaning is unclear, mark as TBD-* on semantics:
   ```yaml
   id: TBD-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-002
   category: evidence_gaps
   statement: "Field CRDSTS: Is this credit status (ACTIVE/INACTIVE) 
              or something else?"
   evidence_gap: "Field definition not extracted; sample data ambiguous"
   resolver: SME / Source Owner
   blocking: no (for BRD); yes before spec if the field is promoted
   ```

---

### 4. Assuming All Branches Are Equal

**Trap:**
```
Program has:
  IF error THEN write_error_message
  ELSE continue_processing

Inference: "The system handles errors gracefully"
Without evidence: Are errors common? Do they stop the transaction?
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- An error branch that is never exercised (dead code) is not a rule
- An error that is logged but ignored is different from an error that stops
  processing
- You need runtime evidence or SME confirmation to understand the intent

**What to do instead:**
1. Check if the error branch is reachable (code analysis, test cases, logs)
2. Check what happens after the error (does processing stop?)
3. Ask SME: "Is this error expected? How often does it occur?"
4. If unclear, mark as TBD-*

---

### 5. Inventing Cross-Program Rules from Similar Code

**Trap:**
```
Program A has: IF CRDAMT > CRDLIM THEN REJECT
Program B has: IF CRDAMT > CRDLIM THEN REJECT

Inference: "The company has a universal rule: no orders over credit limit"
Without evidence: Do all programs implement this? Are there exceptions?
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- Similar code in two programs might be coincidence (copy-paste, independent
  implementations)
- A rule needs evidence from multiple perspectives, not just code pattern
  matching
- There might be programs that *skip* this check

**What to do instead:**
1. Check how many programs implement the rule (2/10? 10/10?)
2. Ask SME: "Is this a company-wide policy?"
3. Check if there are documented exceptions
4. If pattern is inconsistent, mark as TBD-*:
   ```yaml
   id: TBD-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-003
   category: sme_questions
   statement: "Is credit limit enforcement a universal rule applied across 
              all order types, or are there exceptions?"
   evidence: "Programs A and B enforce it; coverage unclear"
   resolver: SME
   blocking: no (can proceed with "most programs enforce it")
   ```

---

### 6. Promoting Unconfirmed Rules to "Approved"

**Trap:**
```
Module analysis lists: BR-CREDIT-CHECK-001 (candidate, needs_sme_review)
BRD synthesis marks it: BR-CREDIT-CHECK-001 (approved)
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- Only the SME can promote a rule to `approved`
- The BRD is an SME *input*, not SME approval
- Prematurely marking a rule as approved skips the validation step

**What to do instead:**
1. Keep all BR-* at status `needs_sme_review` in the BRD
2. Add SME notes field in the BRD for feedback
3. Let the SME (via brd-review.md) confirm each rule
4. Spec-writer handles promotion from `needs_sme_review` → `approved`

---

### 7. Assuming Program Purpose from Name

**Trap:**
```
Program named: PAYMENT-PROCESSOR
Inference: "This program processes all payments"
Without evidence: What types of payments? What is its actual scope?
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- Program names are aspirational or legacy (original intent may have changed)
- A program called PAYMENT-PROCESSOR might only handle refunds, not all payments
- Without reading the program, you don't know its scope

**What to do instead:**
1. Extract program behavior from program analysis, not name
2. Ask SME to clarify program scope if unclear
3. If program scope is ambiguous, mark TBD-*

---

### 8. Inventing Evidence

**Trap:**
```
Module analysis doesn't mention a specific behavior.
BRD author: "This is probably handled in PAYMENT-PROCESSOR, let me note it as 
   BEH-001"
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- You cannot invent evidence that doesn't exist upstream
- BRD consumes module analysis; it doesn't re-analyze programs
- You are creating a false claim with no backing

**What to do instead:**
1. Only extract BEH-* from module analysis, flow analysis, or program analysis
2. If behavior is mentioned but not fully explained, create TBD-*
3. Never claim a behavior without pointing to upstream artifact

---

### 9. Assuming Modernization Decisions Belong in BRD

**Trap:**
```
BRD author: "We should store credit limits in a database table instead of 
   reading from CUSTPF"
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- Modernization decisions (DEC-*) are spec-writer's job, not BRD
- BRD documents *what the system does now*, not *how we'll build it differently*
- Mixing business rules with tech decisions confuses the artifact's purpose

**What to do instead:**
1. Keep BRD focused on observed behaviors and inferred business rules
2. Do NOT include target platform, architecture, or implementation decisions
3. If a decision is implied by the legacy behavior, mark as TBD-* for later
   comparison / spec-writing to address:
   ```yaml
   id: TBD-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-004
   category: downstream_handoff_blockers
   statement: "Decision needed: how to modernize credit limit checks from 
              CUSTPF file read to scalable microservice?"
   resolver: Architecture / Product owner / Spec-writer
   blocking: no (for BRD; blocking before spec / SDD handoff)
   ```

---

### 10. Assuming Weak Inferences Are Strong

**Trap:**
```
Module analysis says: BR-CREDIT-CHECK-001 (weakly_inferred)
BRD author marks it: confidence: high
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- Evidence strength is assigned by the evidence itself, not by your confidence
  in the inference
- Marking weak evidence as high confidence masks the uncertainty from the SME
- The SME needs to see weak inferences so they can investigate

**What to do instead:**
1. Mark confidence based on evidence strength, not your judgment
2. If evidence is weak, mark `confidence: low` or `medium`
3. Add SME notes: "Needs clarification — only one code path shows this"
4. The SME can then decide: confirm it or mark as TBD

---

### 11. Hiding TBDs in Prose

**Trap:**
```
BRD prose: "The system probably validates the credit limit in most cases"
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- "Probably" and "most cases" are uncertainty markers that hide from readers
- The SME cannot approve an artifact if TBDs are hidden in prose
- Downstream (spec-writer) doesn't know what to ask about

**What to do instead:**
1. If uncertain, be explicit:
   ```
   The system validates credit limits (BEH-001).
   
   TBD-001: Does this validation apply to all customer types, 
            or only standard customers?
   ```
2. Use structured TBD-* items, not hedging language in prose
3. The SME can then validate or request investigation

---

### 12. Treating SME Silence as Approval

**Trap:**
```
SME doesn't respond to draft BRD.
BRD author: "No feedback means approval; I'll mark it approved"
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- SME silence is not approval
- SME might be busy, might not understand the artifact, might disagree silently
- Approval must be explicit and named

**What to do instead:**
1. BRD must be marked `in_review`, not `approved`, until SME explicitly signs off
2. SME approval must include:
   - SME name / role
   - Date of review
   - Decision (approved / approved_with_non_blocking_tbd / needs_revision / rejected)
3. If SME is unavailable, the BRD is blocked until they engage

---

### 13. Treating Document Readiness as BRD Success Criteria

**Trap:**
```
BRD author adds section "2.4 Success Criteria":
- The BRD clearly explains the business boundary and actors.
- SMEs can use the BRD to confirm scope and rule direction.
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- These are artifact-quality checks, not business requirements
- SMEs need to validate the capability, rules, behaviors, gaps, and scenarios
- A generic success-criteria section adds review noise and can be mistaken for
  business acceptance criteria

**What to do instead:**
1. Put document-readiness checks in `brd-review.md`
2. Put source-to-section mapping checks in `traceability.md`
3. If a statement is a true business acceptance criterion, defer it to
   `legacy-spec-writer` as `AC-*`
4. Do not include `Success Criteria`, `Success Criiteria`, or similar generic
   document-quality sections in `brd.md`

---

### 14. Inventing Optional Functional-Analysis Details

**Trap:**
```
BRD author sees the template has optional sections for security, workflow
notes, and source documents, then fills them with plausible but unevidenced
content.
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- Optional sections 10-12 are useful only when evidence-backed
- Invented channels, screens, auth rules, diagrams, or source names create
  false confidence and waste SME review time
- Missing optional evidence is a gap to track, not a blank to decorate

**What to do instead:**
1. Fill required sections 1-9 using evidence, SME input, or explicit `TBD-*`
   markers
2. Include Security / Authentication only when evidence identifies roles,
   access control, authentication, authorization, audit, or sensitive actions
3. Include Supporting Workflow or Design Notes only when real diagrams, sequence
   descriptions, or design notes exist in the evidence bundle
4. Include Source Document Mapping only for actual source names, sections,
   pages, or paths
5. If the optional information is expected but missing, create a `TBD-*`

---

### 15. Adding Post-BRD Comparison Into the BRD

**Trap:**
```
BRD author has heard the new system may not support one legacy behavior.
BRD author writes: "Gap2: the new system must implement this behavior."
```

**Why it's wrong:**
- The BRD phase is old-system discovery; SMEs may not know the new system yet
- The BRD proves what the old system does; it does not classify No-gap / Gap1 /
  Gap2 or decide target scope
- Old-vs-new comparison needs new-system evidence and a separate product /
  migration decision process

**What to do instead:**
1. Keep the observed legacy behavior as `BEH-*` with evidence.
2. If the legacy evidence itself is incomplete, create a normal BRD `TBD-*`.
3. If later migration comparison is needed, record that need outside the BRD
   Package or in the orchestrator state, not in `brd.md`:
   ```yaml
   id: TBD-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-004
   category: downstream_handoff_blockers
   statement: "BEH-<CAPABILITY-SLUG>-002 may require post-BRD comparison
              against the new-system design before promotion."
   resolver: Product owner / SME / Risk owner
   blocking: no (for BRD); yes (before spec / SDD handoff)
   ```
4. Do not mint No-gap / Gap1 / Gap2 labels, `AC-*`, `DEC-*`, architecture,
   tasks, or handoff fields in the BRD.

## Checklist: Before Handing BRD to SME

- [ ] Every BEH-* statement is observable fact (not interpretation)
- [ ] Every BEH-* links to ≥1 EV-* (never invented)
- [ ] Every BR-* abstracts ≥1 BEH-* (never invented beyond module seeds)
- [ ] Every BR-* is marked `needs_sme_review` (never `approved` before SME signs off)
- [ ] Every confidence level matches evidence strength (not your judgment)
- [ ] No acceptance criteria in BRD (that's spec-writer)
- [ ] No modernization decisions in BRD (that's spec-writer)
- [ ] No target platform or architecture in BRD (that's spec-writer)
- [ ] No generic `Success Criteria` or document-quality/readiness section in
      `brd.md`
- [ ] No No-gap / Gap1 / Gap2 label, risk-assessment disposition, or
      gap-analysis disposition appears in the BRD Package
- [ ] Required sections 1-9 are present and do not rely on invented channels,
      interfaces, touchpoints, rules, errors, or dependencies
- [ ] Optional sections 10-12 are included only when evidence-backed or
      explicitly SME-confirmed
- [ ] Every uncertain claim is surfaced as TBD-*, not hidden in prose
- [ ] No IBM i facts invented (all programs, fields, files come from upstream)
- [ ] Traceability is complete (every claim traces to evidence)

---

## Escalation: When in Doubt

If you cannot confidently ground a claim in evidence, the safe path is:

1. **Create a TBD-***
   - Category: sme_questions (if only SME can answer)
   - Or: evidence_gaps (if evidence is missing)
2. **Mark as blocking or non-blocking**
   - Blocking: must resolve before BRD is approved
   - Non-blocking: can be carried forward as open question
3. **Assign resolver** (SME, Source Owner, Architecture, etc.)
4. **Let the SME decide** whether to investigate or defer

A BRD with TBDs is better than a BRD with hidden hallucinations.
