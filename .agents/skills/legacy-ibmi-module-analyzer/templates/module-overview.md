## Capability Seeds For spec-writer
| CAP Seed | Business Signal | Evidence Basis | SME Question |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CAP-[SLUG]-001 | [business event / outcome / rule cluster suggesting a capability] | [view / flow / program evidence refs] | [business-language boundary question] |

Capability seeds are business capability candidates, not program-entry
wrappers. Use program flow only as evidence for boundaries and dependencies.

This crosswalk feeds `legacy-brd-writer`. It should not invent missing BRD
content; partial or missing required areas must carry a `TBD-*`.
