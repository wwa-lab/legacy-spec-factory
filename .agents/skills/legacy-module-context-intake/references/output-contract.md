# Output Contract: Module Context Intake

This reference defines the required files under
`00_context_packages/<MODULE-SLUG>/`.

The context package is an intake artifact. It is not an approved module
analysis, BRD, spec, or modernization decision.

blocking_items:
  - id: TBD-CREDIT-CHECK-001
    reason: "Missing evidence authorization."
    owner: legacy-ibmi-evidence-intake
```

Rules:

- `status` must be one of:
  - `ready_for_module_analysis`
  - `ready_with_warnings`
  - `blocked_pending_evidence`
  - `blocked_pending_scope`
  - `blocked_pending_contradiction_review`
- `downstream_next_step` is `legacy-ibmi-module-analyzer` unless blocked.
- `blocking_items[]` is empty only when all gates pass or all remaining items
  are explicitly non-blocking.
- Owner-accepted sparse flow-normalization input is allowed only when
  `flow_normalization_input.status: ready_with_warnings`,
  `quality_level: L1 sparse`, and `risk_acceptance_status: accepted`. Preserve
  all missing views as low-confidence `TBD-*`; do not convert sparse context to
  approved facts.
- `coverage.brd_functional_analysis_hints` is advisory. It tells downstream
  module analysis and BRD preparation which normalized context can feed the
  SME-required BRD sections 1-9 and optional sections 10-12. Missing or partial
  hints must stay visible as gaps; this skill must not fill them by inference.

## View Files

The four view files normalize supplied context into the downstream
`legacy-ibmi-module-analyzer` vocabulary.

Each view file must include:

```markdown
# View N: [Name] - [Module Name]

## Intake Status
- status: draft | sme_confirmed | ready_for_module_analysis | blocked
- source_state: human_confirmed | rag_hydrated | mixed | draft
- primary_sources:
  - [source ID or file path]

## Summary
[Concise supplied context. No invented facts.]

## Evidence-Linked Details
| Claim ID | Knowledge Type | Statement | Evidence | Strength | Review Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Candidate Seeds
| Candidate ID | Candidate Statement | Business Signal | Evidence Basis | Required Review |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Gaps For Module Analyzer
| TBD ID | Category | Question | Evidence | Owner | Blocking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
```

View-specific guidance:

- **View 1, Operation / Business Flow**: actors, business events, BAU rhythm,
  manual intervention, exception lifecycle, candidate business-rule seeds.
- **View 2, System Flow**: upstream/downstream systems, interfaces, integration
  patterns, synchronous/asynchronous boundaries, security/SLA notes.
- **View 3, Program Flow**: entry programs, call paths, shared programs,
  runtime trigger model, suggested program-analysis focus.
- **View 4, Data Flow**: data objects, field dictionary mappings, lifecycle,
  derivation gaps, data ownership, cross-module dependencies.

Candidate seed rules:

- `Candidate Statement` is the business-language candidate or the analysis
  action whose business meaning must be resolved.
- `Business Signal` explains the business behavior, decision, SLA, exception,
  ownership, or control affected by the candidate.
- `Evidence Basis` carries program names, file names, field names, source
  snippets, runtime observations, dictionary IDs, and RAG IDs.
- For View 3 technical candidates, name the business decision that depends on
  the program-analysis focus; do not make a program name the capability
  boundary.

## `rag-evidence-map.md`

Required sections:

```markdown
# RAG Evidence Map - <MODULE-SLUG>

## RAG Runs
| Run ID | Source Snapshot | Dictionary Version | Sensitivity | Status |

## Source Snippets
| Evidence ID | Artifact | Lines | Summary | Strength | Used In |

## Runtime Observations
| Evidence ID | Source | Lines | Observed Detail | Used In |

## Dictionary Mappings
| Standard Field ID | Legacy Reference | Meaning | Owner | Status | Used In |

## Impact Scope
| Target | Impact Type | Evidence | Confidence | Used In |

## Candidate Facts
| Candidate ID | Statement | Business Signal | Evidence Basis | Promotion Status | Required Review |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
```

Rules:

- Preserve original RAG IDs. Do not rename `SNP-*`, `RUN-*`, `DD-*`,
  `RAG-CAND-*`, or `RAG-CONFLICT-*`.
- `Candidate Facts` may not use `approved` as `Promotion Status`; use
  `needs_sme_review`, `blocked`, or `deferred`.
- Program names, files, fields, and source snippets belong in `Evidence Basis`.
  The `Statement` and `Business Signal` columns must remain readable without
  knowing the raw object names.
- If a view cites an evidence ID, that ID must appear here.

## `contradiction-log.md`

Required sections:

```markdown
# Contradiction Log - <MODULE-SLUG>

## Summary
- status: none_found | open_contradictions | blocked
- evaluated_checks_present: true | false

## Open Contradictions
| Conflict ID | Type | Summary | Evidence A | Evidence B | Owner | Blocking |

## Evaluated Checks
| Check | Result | Notes |

## Routing
[What must happen before module analysis or BRD writing.]
```

Rules:

- "No contradictions found" is valid only when `Evaluated Checks` is present.
- Blocking contradictions set `context-index.yaml.intake.status` to
  `blocked_pending_contradiction_review`.
- Contradictions are never silently resolved by this skill.

## `open-questions.md`

Required sections:

```markdown
# Open Questions - <MODULE-SLUG>

## Blocking Questions
| TBD ID | Source ID | Question | Owner | Route To | Needed Before |

## Non-Blocking Questions
| TBD ID | Source ID | Question | Owner | Carry Forward To |

## Non-Blocking Assumptions
| Assumption ID | Statement | Evidence | Review Status |

## Recommended Next Prompt
[Prompt for the next skill.]
```

Rules:

- Mint `TBD-*` for unresolved questions that need Legacy Spec Factory tracking.
- Preserve RAG gap IDs as `Source ID`; do not replace them with TBD IDs.
- Use `blocking: yes` only when the next step would invent facts without the
  answer.

## Promotion Rules

Allowed:

- RAG candidates -> `Candidate Seeds` or `Candidate Facts`
- Retrieval gaps -> `TBD-*` open questions
- Contradictions -> `contradiction-log.md`
- Source snippets/runtime observations -> evidence map entries
- Approved dictionary terms -> terminology context

Forbidden:

- RAG candidates -> approved `BR-*`
- Dictionary terms -> source-proven behavior without code/runtime evidence
- One runtime sample -> normal operating frequency
- No contradiction found -> approval
- `ready_with_warnings` -> downstream approval
- Owner-accepted sparse context -> approved facts, approved `BR-*`, or BRD
  claims without later corroboration

## Local Validation

Use the bundled validator for package-level checks:

```bash
python3 skills/legacy-module-context-intake/scripts/validate_context_package.py \
  00_context_packages/<MODULE-SLUG>/
```

It checks required files, status vocabulary, output-file references, view-to
evidence-map linkage, contradiction-log completeness, and RAG candidate
promotion status. It is a structural guard only; SME approval and semantic
review are still required downstream.
